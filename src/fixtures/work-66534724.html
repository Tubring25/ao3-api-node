          <div class="userstuff"><p>Caitlyn hasted down the stairs when the doorbell rang for a second time, asking herself who might that be at this time. It was past dinner time, after all. She opened the door and needed to look up, because the man standing in front of the door was huge.</p><p>“Caitlyn Kiramman?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“My name is Vander; I’m from <em>Wolves Arboreal</em>. Vi messaged us because you need someone to fix your garden? I was on the way back and passed through here. If it’s alright for you, I would take a look at it and would write you an estimate.” Oh shoot, she had completely forgotten about that. It had only been a day since she had written that email and to be honest, she only had picked this company because she had laughed about the name (why would wolves live on trees? Ridiculous). But if someone from that company was already here, maybe she had hit a lucky shot with contacting them. “I can come back another time if it’s bad right now.”</p><p>“Oh, no. Gods, no. Please, this way.” She grabbed her keys and gesticulated Vander to step back again, so that she could walk past him and open the front gate to the garden. “I was in Ionia for a few months and actually had a gardener employed, who was supposed to look after things, but apparently he didn’t.”</p><p>She opened the gate of the high opaque fence and revealed the mess to Vander, who whistled and pulled out his phone to take a few pictures.</p><p>“That’s quite a mess alright. Do you know how many square-meters your garden has?”</p><p>“Around 1000, but there is a pool directly on the back of the house, which should take around 300 off again. I also would need someone to clean that up too, so in the case that you know someone who does that, could you leave me a contact.”</p><p>Vander was still busy taking pictures. “We can do that too if you want. As long as this pool doesn't have to fulfill sports regulations, we should be good.”</p><p>Well, lucky her. “That sounds great.”</p><p>They talked about a few things, Vander brought up that there are in fact too many plants in her garden and that it made be a good idea to remove a few to let the others grow accordingly. In the end, they agreed on the things that needed to be done and Vander promised that he would throw the estimate into the letter box so that she could think about it. Not even 5 minutes later, he was gone already.</p><p>A few hours later, it was past 9 pm, Caitlyn just had given up cleaning the house and thought about if the pulse setting of the shower-head would be enough or if she should pull out the vibrator, when the door bell rang <em>again.</em> At this time of the evening.</p><p>Disgruntled, she walked to the door and opened it, only to stop right in her tracks. The visitor was a woman, and what a woman she was. Black hair, black make-up, black pants, black leather pants, she left an overall strong impression, and the open jacket showed only bandages around her chest and the chiseled abs. All in all, a mouthwatering sight.</p><p>"Miss Kiramman?"</p><p>Caitlyn managed just so to tear away her away from the bulge she saw in the visitor's groin. "Yes."</p><p>"I'm from <em>Wolves Arboreal. </em>This is the estimate for the job you asked my father to do. Just call, if you made a decision."</p><p>"VI! COME ON!"</p><p>The voice came from somewhere out of Caitlyn's view, but the woman in front of her turned around and raised her middle finger into the direction where the voice coming from. She turned to Caitlyn again.</p><p>"Are we good?"</p><p>"Yes … yes. Say, do you work with your father?" The woman called Vi nodded and Caitlyn smiled at her. "Wonderful. Thank you for delivering this. I'll contact your firm soon."</p><p>Vi nodded and turned around to leave without saying anything else. Caitlyn's eyes stayed glued on that ass in those very tight pants until Vi disappeared out of her field of view before closing and locking the door. She leaned against the door and recalled the image of the woman just now before her inner eye before opening the envelope.</p><p>She read it twice and then reached for the phone to call Vander. The price was a joke. And there was a chance that she could see Vi again. But thinking about Vi made her the decision about how to spend the evening. Before heading for the shower, she grabbed the biggest dildo with a suction cup.</p><p> </p><p>Two days later, at 9 am, the door bell rang and three people stood in front of the door. Vander, Vi (now with red hair) and a thin woman with long, blue braids. All three of them wore dark green overalls with the symbol of their company stitched on them.</p><p>"G'morning, Miss Kiramman. Thanks for getting back to us. These are my daughters Powder and Violet, who help me out from time to time."</p><p>"Nice to meet you." Her gaze lingered on Vi for a moment longer before going to Powder and then to Vander again. "Do you need anything?"</p><p>"If you could open the gate in the back, so that we can get our car in, that would be great."</p><p>Two minutes later, Vander backed his truck into the garden of the Kiramman estate and the three of them began their work.</p><p>Time for Caitlyn to execute her plan. It had three steps.</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Find out what Vi was open for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit.</p>

</ol><p>It was not the most complex or thought-through plan, but it was a plan. For the first step, Caitlyn had at first watched Vi for a bit, but when the woman had reached down once to <em>adjust a tool</em> in her pants, it had been proof enough for her that the bulge she had seen the other day hadn't been an hallucination. Time to get dressed.</p><p>She looked for the skimpiest swimsuit she could find and decided to pick a purple one with a high cut on the thighs and free space from her navel upwards to her collarbone, her tits only covered by two flaps clipped together in the middle. The back mirrored the front except for the flaps and the clip. It was a tight fit, but that was how it was supposed to be.</p><p>Caitlyn stepped out of the backdoor to where the pool of the house was located. Carrying only sunglasses, a hat, sunscreen and a book, she sat down on one of the sunbeds which stood right next to the pool. The pool itself was not to use right now, <em>Wolves Arboreal</em> still needed to fix that one up, but that was not what Caitlyn was here for. She was here to send some signals to a certain contractor.</p><p>The three of them were working on the side of the house. Even if someone would walk around the corner, they wouldn't see anything since there was a hedge acting as an extension to the wall and since it had grown so thick, you needed to walk around it to see the pool.</p><p>For now, Caitlyn could do nothing but lay down, read the book and wait for Vi — or Violet — to appear. She opened the book and began to read it without actually reading it. The book was only acting as a decoy or rather was supposed to pull Vi's attention on its very suggestive cover ( a well dressed woman was getting fucked by a hung maid), so that the gardener got the right idea right away. Caitlyn's library contained tons of these and she also owned the right toys to make the reading sessions more inclusive, but the right partner was rather hard to find.</p><p>"Miss Kiramman?"</p><p>She put the book down and looked over the rim of her glasses. Vi peeked around the hedge.</p><p>"Yes, Miss…?"</p><p>"Just call me Vi. Say, do you have a hose? With another one, we could progress faster?"</p><p>"Sure. Follow me, i have one in the basement."</p><p>Caitlyn put the book on the sunbed, intentionally leaving the side with cover so Vi could see it, and went back to the house. In the glass of the door, she saw how Vi took a look at the book and then proceeded with wide eyes, following Caitlyn into the house. The Kiramman dame accentuated her walk by swinging her hips as much as possible without making it seem obvious. There was not much imagination needed to know that Vi did look nowhere else but on her ass. When they reached the basement where all the other stuff was kept, Caitlyn took her time while bending over to pick up the hose.</p><p>"There you go."</p><p>"Thanks, ma'am. I'll better get back to work now."</p><p>Without saying anything else or even glancing at Cait's cleavage. Caitlyn actually was offended by that. Did she really had called her 'ma'am' just now? What the hell?</p><p>When she reached the ground floor again, Vi had already left the building again. Well, if that hadn't worked, she needed to pull up more drastic measures.</p><p> </p><p>The next time Vi moved around the hedge, the sun had crossed the house and was shining on the terrace with the pool now. The gardener had gotten out of the top part of her overall and had tied it around her waist. She also had gotten rid of her shirt and was doing all her work in nothing but boots, half her overall, a sports bra and gloves. Caitlyn watched her work and salivated about the bulging biceps and the sweat glistening on her chiseled abs. If they would've been alone, Caitlyn would've gotten out of her swimsuit and spread her legs, so that Vi could've taken her right here and now. But she needed a less subtle approach first.</p><p>"Violet?"</p><p>The gardener looked up. "Yes?"</p><p>"Are you alright? Have you remembered your sunscreen?" She lifted the bottle of sunscreen she had brought with her earlier. "Do you need any?"</p><p>Vi inspected her arms and then nodded. "Yes, I could use some."</p><p>"Let me help you out, won't you?", Caitlyn purred and strutted past the pool to Vi. "Some spots are … hard to reach."</p><p>It was obvious, that Vi weighted her options, but eventually she shrugged and raised her arms. Caitlyn stepped behind her and pressed some lotion out of the bottle to start with her shoulders. The applying of the lotion was only secondary, the primary objective was to feel her up.</p><p>"That's a nice tattoo you got there." Caitlyn rubbed her hands over Vi's shoulder blades, tracing the gears and smoke clouds. "Only on your back … or somewhere else too?"</p><p>"Just the back."</p><p>"Hmhm."</p><p>She slipped her fingers just under the hem of the bra. Surprisingly, there was nothing sexual in this because it really was important to get all the spots you usually just would swipe over. On the contrary, there was a clear sexual intent in her hands wandering around Vi's waist to rake over her abs. And right that was, when Vi grabbed Caitlyn's wrists and pulled them away.</p><p>"Thank you very much, but i don't have time for this. I have a job to do."</p><p>She wrung the bottle of sunscreen out of Caitlyn's hand and applied it to herself. Caitlyn pouted over the sudden rejection, but that didn't stop her from trying again.</p><p>Later, she offered Vi something to drink and when she invited her into her kitchen, she seductively leaned over the counter and asked if Vi was thirsty for anything else, the gardener emptied the glass in one go and slammed it back on the counter.</p><p>"Lady, if you want to suck my dick, just say so and safe me from this … whatever this is."</p><p>Caitlyn licked her lips. "Don't mind if i do."</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The overall was pulled down quickly and her boxers were pulled down to free up the bulge of her cock, and Caitlyn hummed to herself the whole while — that was, until Vi’s cock actually sprung free, and the woman’s eyes went wide.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn had been with young, inexperienced ones before, and they were never that fulfilling. She also had to deal with smaller cocks and, while she was no size queen, she enjoyed a nice, meaty prick to fill her up. The only redeeming qualities of those like Vi was that they could fuck like rabbits, but even that was rarely satisfactory - but that was all okay, because she wasn’t there for the sex, and if she wanted satisfaction there were plenty of people that would be willing to plow her for a night. But Vi’s cock was among the largest she’d ever seen, by far bigger than the one of her last girlfriend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re perfect,” Caitlyn purred indistinctly, the meaty, bulbous prick-head just an inch from her face. She wasn’t sure if Vi heard her, but she was speaking mostly to herself by that point. Vi just watched as Caitlyn’s mouth descending on the waiting cock, and the moment her large, plush lips touched the rubbery head, the woman hummed aloud. Her plush lips squished around the solid tip in a soft kiss, and she held herself there long enough to get a taste of the girl’s meat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She lifted her lips a centimeter off the cock and smiled up at Vi. “Not too much noise, sweetie. Not that your sister hears us."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who cares? Get on with it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi grabbed Caitlyn by her scalp and pushed her against her cock. Caitlyn didn't mind as she very much wanted to wrap her lips around the cock and take the meat into her mouth; it was the best way to get the feel of a cock, she’d always believed. Her pouty lips parted and grazed the edge of the girth, with the tip of her tongue poking out just enough to run across the veiny skin. It was a long, careful lick from the tip to base, just to get a feel with what she was working with, before she moved right back up to the top and grinned at the dick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mouth opened fully and she popped the first few inches of cock into her mouth, wrapping her lips snugly around the stiff length, and Vi let out a muffled groan. Caitlyn flicked the angry tip with her tongue while sucking hard and quick, and a long, vacuuming slurp ran out. She pushed herself down on the rod, and her tongue rolled against the throbbing head and slipped under it as she moved. It easily swept into the back of her throat, filling out her mouth in a way that so few cocks could. Her gag-reflex was nonexistent, and the cock pushed all the way back until it was poised to sink right into her throat and halfway down her esophagus, should she wish.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She held herself there for several long moments, holding in her breath and simply allowing Vi to experience the saliva-soaked warmth of her mouth. Her nimble tongue assaulted the dick the entire time she had it impaling her mouth, tickling and tasting the hard meat and generally edging Vi on. Finally, after she’d bathed Vi’s cock in saliva and thoroughly lashed her tongue over every inch inside her mouth, she pulled off; but she did so slowly, and kept her lips wrapped tight around it the whole while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled off with a loud, exaggerated pop, and ran her tongue over her full lips. But instead of being impressed, she saw Vi just staring at her without showing much of a reaction. Caitlyn was good at putting on a show, but that was somewhat disappointing. Time to turn it up a notch. Her hand moved around to grab hold of the meaty girth while she extended her tongue and ran it across the underside, making sure to be as loud as physically possible. Actually, she had no care of being heard or caught, because she really wanted Vi to understand the pleasure she could offer and judging from the look the woman gave her, Vi liked what she saw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she licked her tongue across the girthy shaft she rotated her head from side to side, swiveling the broad of her tongue so that she covered as much cock-meat as possible. She slurped on it loudly, and at the same time inhaled with her mouth and sucked up the fine drizzle of saliva that coated the length. She pressed down occasionally with her lips in a sloppy kiss, molding her lips to the throbbing flank and depositing a fresh layer of syrupy drool that rolled down it with glacial slowness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At any point where her mouth wasn’t kissing and her tongue wasn’t licking, her hand was stroking at the dick with tightly-clasped fingers. She pumped so hard and fast that droplets squelched between her fingers and flung out into the open air, spattering Caitlyn’s chest with liquids of her own making. The combined stimulus turned Vi into a flush-faced mess, more than the woman probably liked. The dick throbbed in-hand and between her lips, but not violently - not yet. If nothing else, Vi wasn’t a quick shot, and Caitlyn still had a bit more work to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The very idea that she’d swallow down Vi’s seed had her let loose, and Caitlyn was forced to be quick to surround the first two inches with her mouth and take it into her wet cavern. Thick, salty spurts of semen splashed against the roof of her mouth and against the back of her throat, hitting with the force of a gun. She swallowed it all down with quick gulps, using her tongue to shift the thickest and stickiest of the fluid into the back of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Vi didn’t stop with just a few pulses, and her steadily pumping cock threatened to overflow Caitlyn’s mouth with the rich, hot baby-batter. It was a hearty load that was meant to be pumped into a woman’s cunt for the sole purpose of impregnation, and Caitlyn just knew that if Vi let loose inside of her, she’d be carrying a child. The idea was not unpleasant, actually, and decided to stick a point in that - first, she needed to focus on swallowing down every last drop that Vi unleashed into her mouth. Her gulping was loud and rhythmic, almost exaggerated, and if Vi was really paying attention she’d see her smooth neck ripple with each swallow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi’s length didn’t subside when she stopped cumming, but Caitlyn figured she had plenty of backed-up loads in her, and was eager to test just how long and hard the girl could go before she tapped out. As the torrent coming from still-stiff pole subsided and stopped, Caitlyn pulled away from it. She slurped the last few drops of salty semen into her mouth and ran the flat of her tongue over the flushed cock-head to ensure that every last bit of it was cleaned off her cock, and then smiled up at Vi. But that was not reciprocated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Finally." Vi pulled her pants back up. "Was about time."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wha- huh?" Caitlyn was perplexed. "That was it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do you mean? You pay me for getting your garden under control, not to fuck you. I have places to be. But thanks for sucking me off."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi was back in the garden faster than Caitlyn could do anything and left the homeowner alone in her kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What the heck? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>Caitlyn spent the rest of the day sulking on the couch. Vi hadn't spoken to her again, the three gardeners had disappeared after the clock had passed 4 pm and after Vander had pulled the van out of the garden, Caitlyn had made her peace with nothing special happening this evening anymore. Which meant, that it was time to entertain herself.</p><p>Since dinner was just leftovers from the day before, she didn't have to bother with cooking and so could just walk to the upper floor to take a shower. But taking a shower alone wasn't option, a companion was needed. On her way to the bathroom, Caitlyn grabbed the dildo with the suction cup along wit her towels and clothes.</p><p>It didn't take much to get ready, Caitlyn just got out of her clothes and let them drop on the floor before entering the walkable shower. The dildo got propped against the marble tiles right under the shower head and was ready for its use.</p><p>Of course, the cleaning came first before Caitlyn intended to cum, this much order had to be kept in mind. But as soon as the sweat and the remains of the sunscreen were washed away, Caitlyn's fingers wandered down to her pussy and she began to play with herself rather swiftly. Soon, her fingers weren't enough anymore and Caitlyn lined her pussy up with the dildo waiting for finally getting work.</p><p>There was no time for a slow start and Caitlyn pushed her hips against the wall right away. A hum escaped her throat when the toy filled her up, while her ass touched the cold marble. The warm water raining down from above brought her a great sensory experience. This feeling was good, but not good enough to just stay like this and let the dildo just fill her out. She tilted her head back, facing the falling water and with a picture of Vi in mind, Caitlyn began to fuck herself on the toy. Only slowly at first, she slid up and down by just gyrating her hips, picking up the pace by every second.</p><p>Kneading her own tits, she thought about how it could be Vi rearranging her guts with that fat dick of hers, that it was her hands touching her wherever the handywoman pleased.</p><p>"I thought that you were a hoe, but for some reason i did not expect to catch in the act right away."</p><p>Caitlyn's eyes shot open and her hands moved to instinctively cover herself while the shower kept running. Vi stood in the door frame in her green overall, leaning against the expensive wood.</p><p>"Aw Cupcake, no need to cover up the goods. I was just enjoying the show."</p><p>Caitlyn stayed like this, the dildo still buried within her. "Cupcake?"</p><p>"Big cups in the front, the cake in the back. Makes sense to me."</p><p>It didn't to Caitlyn. "Why are you here?"</p><p>"Well…" Vi began to undress, dropping her clothes on Caitlyn's, showing off her chiseled body in the progress. "… i thought, that there is a rich, cock-hungry slut is waiting in here and since she already sucked me off, she probably wants more."</p><p>Ignoring everything else, Vi stepped into the shower, which was spacious enough to fit even more people within its glass walls. Not that this ever had been required.</p><p>"Am I wrong?"</p><p>Caitlyn wanted to say yes, but that would not have been the truth. It had actually sullied her mood that Vi had disappeared after sucking her off.</p><p>"No answer? Thought so. Now, how do you want it? Clean or dirty?" Vi grabbed her cock and pumped it, bringing it to full mast. "Ah, who am i kidding? You sucked my dick after it being in sweaty pants for hours. You like it nasty."</p><p>Before Caitlyn could react, Vi had pulled her off the dildo and pushed her against the glass wall face-first, her tits pressed flat against the glass. The gardener lined up her cock with Caitlyn's snatch and pushed it in right away. She laughed when her hips met Caitlyn's ass, bottoming out from the start, leaving Caitlyn fuller than she had ever been.</p><p>
  <span>It was too smooth to be put to the task of fucking a girl against her will, but that was exactly what Vi did as she drew her dick backward. The thick shaft crawled out of her, and Caitlyn felt every inch of the length that so mortifyingly filled her up. She cried out for every last bit of it, and her entire body fidgeted and squirmed to try and dislodge her assailant – but the other girl was stronger still, and she could not shift one bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi kissed at the back of her neck and down along her shoulders when she thrust right back inside, working her cock into the hot, tight envelope of her cunt with laughable ease. She pushed herself down, the thick bulk of her shaft spearing into the tightness of Caitlyn's folds, and made the woman whimper with unbearable strain. It was like nothing she ever expected to feel in any set of circumstances at all, and she didn't want it one single bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet, her words fell on deaf ears and her actions were essentially a waste of energy. She couldn't stop it without hurting Vi, and she didn't want to hurt her.... even then. She, instead, shuddered and grunted at the feeling of that thick dick spearing into her snatch, stretching her out with such groaning, unbearable intensity, leaving her eyes watering and her breath gasping. It was insane, and she could not handle it one bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had to, though, because Vi clearly wasn't stopping. As she held her wrists with one hand, grabbed her hips with the other, and kissed at her neck with her mouth, she thrust; easy, precise, and powerful. That big, broad cock speared into her snatch and stretched her out, making her insides feel like paste. Caitlyn could only gasp at her touch, eyes watering, as the thickness delved through her tight pussy and stretched her mouth more than she had ever experienced before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wedged itself into her hot, silken depths, leaving her feeling remorselessly stuffed up. It was huge inside of her, and regardless of its actual size, Caitlyn was small and slender – not fit for that sort of thing. It didn't matter that Vi thrust in so methodically, the simple act of it was straining for Caitlyn. She gasped against the glass she was forced into, and she squirmed once more with renewed desperation; yet truly, there was nothing she could do to stop it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop... Vi, ah, <em>ahn</em>, <em>mmmmf </em>– stop - “</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn mewled against the glass wall as Vi pressed her into it all the wall more thoroughly. Their bodies were touching more than ever, with little space between them; mere centimeters, probably. Her hips fitted into the crook of her client's ass whilst she rolled her hips with mechanical force, stirring up her pussy with that truncheon of hardness. The stretching and pushing of walls was a gasp-inducing sensation, and one that made her eyes leak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi moved well. Too well, probably. She rolled her hips before dragging her dick backward, pulling out of her with wet precision and sloppy intensity. She tugged herself back, withdrawing that thick, huge shaft with wet enthusiasm. The hardness yanked free quite easily, but Caitlyn mewled for that, too. She did not like it one bit, but the size of it, and the way that Vi moved it, still made her toes curl and her insides shudder. That was not something that she could stop, and despite herself, the kisses and touches against her neck were making her feel hot and flush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi moved without listening to her words nor the complaints of her body. Her hips pushed and thrust, driving her thick dick down into the tight vice of her snatch. That big, fat shaft rolled on through her, piercing her and stuffing her up beyond anything Caitlyn could have ever imagined. She was embarrassed to say that it forced the breath out of her lungs each time it happened, but there was really no other option when dealing with something so big. She was not built for such things, whereas Vi was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The redhead kissed at the back of her neck and held her tightly; too tightly for good sense. She squeezed her hip and pinned her wrists while resting against her in a straight, prone-like position, mashing Caitlyn all up against the slick, wet tile. The sound of the shower seemed to muffle her cries, if nothing else. She was not sure if she was grateful for that or mortified, but neither did she think it mattered all that much. In the grand scheme of things, the lewdness was... shocking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Vi,” Caitlyn wheezed, “Vi, stop, this – stop, you – ah -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn't form words properly when that big, fat dick rolled on through her, stuffing her up more than she could properly bear. It made her flinch and fidget with each passing moment, despite her best intentions. Her face flinched and tightened up with each deep, drilling stroke, and her entire body quivered when it drew back so forcefully. The intensity of it was blinding, a strong, potent sensation that she'd never really experienced before in her life, and it ran her ragged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn shuddered in the face of that mechanical thrusting. The in and out pushes, the hard, tight shoves, the power behind it, made her quiver like a tightly wound string. The way that Vi kept on moving, kept on thrusting, was confusing and intense. She didn't like it one bit, but her body could not help but respond in the face of such earnest skill. Vi wasn't just slamming away at her, and she wasn't treating her like porcelain. It was steady and methodical, a grinding, rolling pace that really let the Caitlyn feel it, for better or worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shuddered against the wall, her fingers uselessly clawing in their captivity, her feet pushing up as if to work off the stimulation. Strange thrills were running along her spine as she was fucked with such methodical precision, and it made her body tingle. She groaned, her eyes wincing and almost watering, as that hard dick pushed on through her. She felt that vascular girth sliding in and out, spearing out of folds, working through her with such easy, delicious intensity, a strange parade of sensation she couldn't understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt it grinding against her insides, pushing and swelling and stretching oh-so-easily. It stabbed in deep, hitting spots that she didn't even know were there, and sent tingles through her accordingly. Her protests wheezed out of her lips at the strange overstimulation. She did not know how to handle it – any of it, really – and it kept on filling her with shock more than anything else. In and out, steady ad precise, the cock stabbed into her cunt and worked it out around it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was fucked up against the wall in ways she couldn't understand. The smoothness of it had vascular meat sawing into her snatch, pressing up against her deepest spots in eye-rolling ways, before drawing back again. The futa moved too smoothly, too easily, bringing herself around in long, filling arcs, only to do it again, and again, and again. Caitlyn gasped and shuddered at her touch, half-involuntarily, half without control. She wheezed, the breath misting out of her lips, as it just kept on going, adding to the fog of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn was beyond whimpering right then. She was trying to work off the immeasurable strain of being fucked, which was to say nothing of the strange, tingling satisfaction that came when that hard dick thumped into her deepest of spots. The head was positively rubbing her cervix, or so it seemed, hitting places that it really should not have; maybe it was, maybe it was not, but it felt like it, and that was enough. More than enough for Caitlyn to quiver, and more than enough for her to gasp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With watering eyes, she shuddered and contracted around that hard slab of thrusting dickmeat. She could not help herself, though she really wished there was another alternative or course of action – but she was locked into what came with dreadful certainty. She could not stop the quivering of her body or the shivering of her spine, and she couldn't prevent the way that it left her body shaking. It was a mortifying experience, but she couldn't stop any of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her body kept on quivering as Vi thrust into it with such methodical precision, easily stretching her out as she took her own pleasures. Her lips were constant against her neck, just kissing at everything in reach without saying anything, making a mockery of anything she had ever felt. Those touches, those husky breaths, the march of that dick, pushed her inexperienced body right to the edge, and she could not last through it all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shamefully, with gasping desperation, that cock fucked her to an orgasm. She felt it approaching the entire time, felt it shuddering through her with delicious intensity, a surge of sensation that overwhelmed her defenses. She quivered in the grip of something that she couldn't understand, and she shook with the potency of a climax that dimmed anything else she'd ever experienced before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she came, she did so tumultuously, with strain, and with overwhelming pleasure. Her head went blank for those moments, and her eyes practically rolled up into her skull at the sensation of quivering satisfaction that rolled over her Time and place failed to hold any meaning as the sensation of a good, hard climax burned through her, practically making her drool. It was far more intense than any climax she'd ever felt before in her life, and it set her off hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mind was blank, her eyes unseeing. She knew what was happening, and she knew what was going on, but she couldn't process it nor begin to understand it. All of that sensation just rumbled through her in a wave of pure sensation, leaving her groaning and gasping in ways that she did not want to love but was forced to. The pure intensity of it was too intense for her to handle, and she was a quivering, shaking mess in Vi's hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There you go,” Vi husked against her neck, "And now: for the finale!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi came before Caitlyn could say or do anything. Without a warning, Vi pumped her cum into Caitlyn's pussy without stopping to fuck her. She felt the hot batter fill her up, along with the hot throbbing cock over and over again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn whined shamefully. It was the most intense orgasm she'd ever experienced in her life, and it left her drooling. She could not properly think about what had happened or what she had allowed, for she was still hazy of mind, dizzy of brain; conscious thought failed her. She just went along with it, for in her shameful state, words lacked understandable meaning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But let's make it even better,” Vi said, her voice thick. “We can have more fun than this. I bet you have a fancy ass bathroom we can turn upside down, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn managed to nod and Vi backed up to pull out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good. Clean yourself up and get there fast."</span>
