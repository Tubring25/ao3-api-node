  <strong>Part I</strong>
</p><p>Eventually, Vi was going to get this right.</p><p>No, truly, she just needs time.</p><p>And patience, probably. She’s actually pretty good at being patient if you ask her. Being in prison for almost 8 years will do that to you.</p><p>She’s got roughened up after all the shit she went through, from losing all her family to a car accident and then being wrongfully imprisoned for a crime she didn’t commit.</p><p>So yeah, all things considered, one could say she’s been through some shit.</p><p>She’s fine now, though.</p><p>The good news is, she’s developed an awesome skill in jail, which is basically having the memory of a CIA agent; 26 days since she’s been out of prison, 15 days since she paid the bills, 10 days since she took out the trash and 3 days without showering (she’s still getting used to that, having hot water and being able to shower for longer than 2 minutes).</p><p>2796 days since she last saw her siblings alive, 2792 days since she went to prison.</p><p>2798 days since she last hugged someone.</p><p>Things are going fine, Vi considers.</p><p>Right now, she’s just having a hard time learning how to fucking cook a piece of meat because honestly, who thought it was a good idea to let her go out in the world after 7 years in jail just to be her own person?</p><p>She’s still learning how to use the shower from her new apartment. Adjusting is hard as fuck, last time she was out was when she was around 15 and apparently, society thought it was a good idea to just, move on <em>without</em> her.</p><p>Nice, cool. No hard feelings.</p><p>She’s also not using her bed. Or the couch. It’s all still too soft compared to what she was sleeping in a month ago.</p><p>The floor from her apartment is just fine, even nicer now that she’s getting used to sleeping with a blanket.</p><p>Being cold is shit.</p><p>Her neighbors are… nice. Probably. Vi wouldn’t be able to know it anyways since she doesn’t go out.</p><p>She’s memorized different ways to escape in case someone decides she’s a threat to the building, probably based on her tattoos or the obvious signs of being an ex-con. So far, nobody has complained about her, which is as nice as it can get for Vi.</p><p>Despite her lack of skills when it comes to interacting with people, a local bar called ‘The Last Drop’ still hires her to work all weekends during the night as a server.</p><p>Her boss, a guy called Benzo, is okay in her opinion. He pays her enough for Vi to be able to live on her own and pay the bills, so it’s enough for her standards.</p><p>Being wrongfully imprisoned also comes with a few perks, one of them being the amount of money she received from the government as a reassurance for, you know, destroying her life. It’s fine, at least she doesn’t have to worry about being in debt.</p><p>So far, everything’s been going fine.</p><p>3 days since she last went grocery shopping, 8 days since she slept more than 2 hours, <em>2796 since someone last truly cared for her—</em></p><p>There’s a knock on her door and she feels her body freeze.</p><p>Could it be the police? No, she hasn’t done anything wrong, she’s been staying out of trouble.</p><p>The old lady from the second floor? Maybe Vi shouldn’t have helped her took out the trash the other day, maybe she should’ve just stayed inside her apartment and not go out and maybe—</p><p>It’s a woman. Around Vi’s age, blue hair, and uptight posture. Vi doesn’t think she’s seen her before.</p><p>She looks like she’d rather be anywhere else but here and <em>hey</em>, something Vi can relate to.</p><p>“Hello, sorry to bother you,” posh accent and a soft voice invade the space, “but it seems like I’ve lost the keys to my apartment.” She explains politely and <em>oh</em>.</p><p>So that’s what this is about.</p><p>“I didn’t steal them.” She’s quick to clarify before her right to speak is silenced by someone who’s clearly way above Vi’s status.</p><p>The woman seems taken aback.</p><p>“I… wasn’t accusing you of that. I was just wondering if I could borrow your phone to call a locksmith. My phone has died.” She explains slowly and Vi finally breathes.</p><p>“Oh. Uh—sure.” She gestures for her to get in while Vi looks for her phone.</p><p>It’s not hard to find it, she only has like 4 valuable objects and one of them is the blanket extended across the living room’s floor.</p><p>The woman doesn’t comment on it, thankfully, only picking the phone with a low <em>thank you</em> before making a call.</p><p>Distantly, Vi realizes it’s the first time someone’s been inside her apartment. It’s rather pathetic, how out of the loop she is when it comes to people, society.</p><p>“Thank you, you saved my life.” The woman says after a few minutes, snapping her back to reality. Vi blinks.</p><p>“No problem.” She replies awkwardly.</p><p>The woman seems to catch her demeanor and quickly starts motioning to the door.</p><p>“I should go now, probably. Thank you again.” Vi opens the door and the woman looks back at her one last time. “I’m Caitlyn, by the way. I live on the apartment from across yours.”</p><p>Vi has to physically stop herself from saying something like <em>pink</em> or <em>516</em> or <em>fuck off</em> back, slowly managing a low “Vi.” Before closing the door quietly.</p><p>She considers it to be her daily dosage of socializing and lays down on the blanket.</p><p>She sleeps for 30 minutes before a nightmare wakes her up.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She has a simple routine, just like in prison.</p><p>Of course, there are a few things that change compared to it, like warm food that actually tastes like something or having her own bathroom.</p><p>You know, privacy and all that.</p><p>But mostly sticks to a strict schedule in order to not <em>think</em> about the things that hurt. It’s something she’s been training for so long now it comes as a second nature.</p><p>She’s still shit at cooking, but it takes time, she repeats to herself.</p><p>Nightmares come and go without Vi being able to remember what they’re about. She wakes up with her cheeks covered in tears and a cold sensation drowning her body, but she can’t truly <em>know</em> why.</p><p>Loud noises and sudden movements make her mind freeze but she tries to ignore it. She sticks to her routine and ignores any weird game her brain might try to pull her into.</p><p>Of course, there are a few things she can’t truly leave behind. She was a troubled kid when, you know, she was <em>still</em> a kid. Now, as an adult, that habit hasn’t changed much. She tries hard not to get into fights, to stay out of people’s business, mostly for herself; she’s just getting used to warm showers, she’s not about to lose that again because of a stupid fight.</p><p>Except she almost is. There’s a drunk guy at the bar and Vi only manages to take a deep breath for like 10 seconds before her patience is out the window and she’s left with a purple eye. But it’s fine, <em>you should see the other guy</em>.</p><p>She half expects Benzo to fire her fight there and then, but he doesn’t, only complains about the drunk dude and tells Vi to take the night off, saying that she deserves it.</p><p>Weirdest guy ever. No wonder he runs a bar.</p><p>So now she’s back at her apartment, almost 7 in the morning with a black eye that hurts like a bitch and a blanket that it’s still <em>too</em> soft to sleep on.</p><p>She sits on the floor doing mostly nothing until there’s a knock on her door.</p><p>Here’s the thing, Vi’s an objective person, with an objective perspective of the world. She just punched a guy in public, which means there should be a cop on the other side of the door, right?</p><p>Well, the world’s not objective at all, because the person waiting at the door is Caitlyn, her neighbor.</p><p>She’s even more confused because Caitlyn takes a double look at her face and frowns, concerned.</p><p>“Goodness, are you okay?” she asks startled, and Vi’s brain stops for a second.</p><p>“Uh— yeah, peachy. You should see the other guy.” She answers lightly.</p><p>She looks down to Caitlyn’s hands holding a box and the blue-haired seems to remember the original reason why she was here in the first place.</p><p>“Oh! Right. I brought you something, as a thanks for the other day.” She clarifies, holding the box for Vi to take it.</p><p>She hesitates before taking it slowly, suspicious.</p><p>“You didn’t have to do that, it’s fine.” Vi doubts.</p><p>Caitlyn waves her off.</p><p>“Truly, just accept it. I baked enough for a whole family, and they’ll get wasted if they’re at my apartment for too long.”</p><p>Vi inspects inside the box to see 6 cupcakes, all elegantly decorated with pink frosting.</p><p>“I’ve never had cupcakes before.” She comments lightly, her mouth opening before her brain processes the thought. Caitlyn’s eyes widen.</p><p>“Never? Like, ever?” she seems surprised, mostly, but not in a bad way. Vi nods.</p><p>“Yep. First time.”</p><p>“Oh, well in that case you should let me know what you think about them. I like to bake a lot; it’d be nice to have someone review my baking.” She smiles sheepishly and Vi smiles back shyly.</p><p>“Sure, thank you.”</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Turns out, Caitlyn was being modest.</p><p>The cupcakes are fucking amazing and Vi has a few seconds to experiment the feeling of jealousy at her talent before she forgets it, too focused on eating them quickly before someone steals it from her. It’s an irrational thought, considering she lives alone. Still, in the back of her mind there’s a voice that whispers for her to hide them under the couch, where no one can take them from her.</p><p>The next day, she knocks on Caitlyn’s door to return the box, not without complimenting her baking skills.</p><p>She’s about to go back to her apartment when Caitlyn stops her.</p><p>“Did you get your eye checked by a doctor?” she asks, concerned.</p><p>Vi dismisses her.</p><p>“Honestly, it’s fine. Don’t worry about it, I’ve had worse.”</p><p>She’s not lying about that, her whole body has more rough scars than a black eye and a little scratch on her eyebrow.</p><p>Caitlyn still doesn’t look convinced.</p><p>“Would you humor me and let me check it, just in case?” there’s a pleading look and Vi has to look down to ignore the urge to say yes. “My father is a doctor; I’ve got a lot of supplies. Please.”</p><p>Vi sighs before nodding.</p><p>Caitlyn’s apartment is lot more equipped than Vi’s, it’s the first observation she makes once she’s inside.</p><p>All things seem to be on their place just like Caitlyn’s persona; clean and neat. There’s also enough furniture in the living room to equipe Vi’s entire apartment.</p><p>She checks her surroundings, taking in the lack of pictures around the walls. She can relate to that.</p><p>Caitlyn comes back.</p><p>She gestures for Vi to sit on her couch as she looks through a first aid kit.</p><p>Vi looks around while she opens the bottle of alcohol and takes a piece of cotton. She hisses quietly when the burning sensation invades the cut above her eye, the blue-haired mutters a low apology before checking her eye.</p><p>“Did you put ice on it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She looks unpleased with that information, “You should, probably. Other than that, I think you’re fine.”</p><p>Vi nods, “Nice.”</p><p>Caitlyn seems to weight around something before she opens her mouth again, “Is this something that happens a lot?”</p><p>“It’s fine,” she dismisses her, “I wasn’t lying when I said I’ve had worse.”</p><p>“Oh.” Caitlyn whispers quietly, thoughtful. “Does— is it someone that you know?”</p><p>Vi frowns, not following.</p><p>“Like, a boyfriend or—”</p><p>“Oh, no.” She snorts, “It’s— usually just random assholes on the streets. I have a bad temper, that’s just all.” She waves her hand around.</p><p>“Sorry, just wanted to make sure.” Caitlyn explains softly. “You don’t seem like the type to punch people.”</p><p>Vi blinks at that, it’s almost comical.</p><p>
  <em>Is she serious?</em>
</p><p>“Are you blind or something?” she gestures vaguely at her fists and face tattoo.</p><p>Caitlyn shakes her head.</p><p>“I don’t judge people based on their looks,” she explains, “you were nice to me the other day, it’s all I need to know.”</p><p>Vi wants to laugh at how naïve she is, but there’s a weird weight forming in her stomach at the thought of someone perceiving her as <em>nice</em>. She ignores the feeling.</p><p>“Well, sorry to break it to you but I am exactly the way I look. Prison will do that to you.” She grimaces, not entirely comfortable about where this is going.</p><p>She should probably go back to her apartment before this clearly sheltered person starts screaming for help because a random ex-con just irrupted into her house.</p><p>Caitlyn doesn’t bat an eye at that, “Well, that explains the tattoos.” It’s all she says and Vi snorts despite herself.</p><p>“Yep, lots of free time.” She comments sourly at the thought. It was way too much free time, just thinking about what could’ve gone different, where Vi could be know if prison hadn’t fucked her up this much.</p><p>“How long were you in prison?” Caitlyn voice denotes nothing but curiosity.</p><p>“7 years. Almost 8.” She says awkwardly. It’s quite a weird chat to have with her strangely polite neighbor.</p><p>“Oh, that’s quite a lot.” Caitlyn reflects softly.</p><p>There’s an uncomfortable silence and Vi decides she’s done enough talking for the day, her throat already feels dry and tight. She hasn’t felt the urge to cry in 24 days, she won’t be getting it now.</p><p>“Yep. I should— better get going. Thanks for… that.” She ends it awkwardly. Caitlyn nods before getting up and opening her door to let Vi go.</p><p>She goes back to her cave. Alone again.</p><p>It’s for the better.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She’s not getting it right at <em>all</em>, actually. The cooking thing.</p><p>Her hands are useful for a bunch of shit like punching people or sheltering herself from the angry bats that wardens used to throw at her when she started disobeying, but <em>this</em>? It’s a losing battle.</p><p>Apparently, homemade burritos are harder to make than she had originally thought. It’s actually a good thing that she’s only expected to clean the bar and not actually cook because she’d probably be unemployed, and she doesn’t want that.</p><p>Of course, her little problem gets magically solved when there’s a gentle knock on her door, Caitlyn waiting on the other side expectantly.</p><p>It’s been 12 days since Caitlyn brought her a piece of brownie made by her. Maybe Vi is still surviving purely thanks to Caitlyn’s snacks, the blue-haired seems to have a strange way of coping with stress, cooking large amounts of food even though she lives alone. It’s cool either way, Vi is there.</p><p>It’s not specifically relevant information for Vi to keep count on, but there’s a soothing feeling every time she counts to 10-12 days and Caitlyn comes back, with a new snack made for her.</p><p>“Quick question.” Caitlyn’s voice snaps her out of her thoughts.</p><p>Vi raises her eyebrows amused.</p><p>“Hello to you, too.”</p><p>She seems to catch herself and there’s a light pink invading her cheeks, “Sorry. Hi, hello. Do you happen to like pasta?”</p><p>There’s a vague voice in her head, answering <em>who the fuck doesn’t like pasta?</em> but Vi’s more interested in knowing <em>why</em> Caitlyn wishes to know that.</p><p>“Yeah, why?” she frowns.</p><p>Caitlyn seems unusually awkward.</p><p>“I made pasta and there’s like, a lot of it. I’m bad at proportions. I was wondering if you’d like some of it.”</p><p>That is actually the nicest thing someone could offer Vi right now.</p><p>Fuck the burritos, she’s in a pasta mood now.</p><p>“Sure, I’d like that.”</p><p>Caitlyn’s face lightens up at that, clearly pleased. “Good. I’ll—” she mimics back to her apartment, “would you like to come in? Company would be nice.”</p><p>Vi falters, “You sure?”</p><p>It is one thing to be completely obsessed with your neighbor’s ability to cook but she’s not sure Caitlyn would be delighted to have someone like <em>Vi</em> to eat dinner with. Even Benzo pointed out once, during her lunch break, how she’s sort of an animal when eating.</p><p>She doesn’t want to scare her off and end up not getting any more flowery-themed tappers full of brownies.</p><p>She’s also just getting used to eating alone without being surrounded by a bunch of strangers who just happen to be in the same shitty place as Vi, eating gray, tasteless food.</p><p>The blue-haired nods, “I am.”</p><p>She ends up agreeing because the last time someone invited her for dinner was probably way <em>before</em> 2796 days, and Vi can’t even remember how Jericho’s food tastes like or if Powder’s tooth gap was one millimeter or if Vander smelled like wood or flannel—</p><p>She resets the count. 0 days starting from now.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Caitlyn is, in fact, slightly… <em>impressed</em> by Vi’s capacity to slurp her noodles like a fucking vacuum cleaner, but she’s polite enough to just smile and focus on her own plate.</p><p>She sits with her back straight and eats with the elegancy of a princess, a napkin resting on her lap.</p><p>Across the table, Vi devours her pasta with the delicacy of a bear.</p><p>It’s probably the nicest meal she’s ever had in a long time.</p><p>At some point she realizes she’s probably being rude by intruding into Caitlyn’s house to eat dinner and not even try to make a conversation.</p><p>She looks up from her plate and finds her already staring at Vi with a small smile plastered on her face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Caitlyn seems to falter, searching for the right words.</p><p>“Nothing, I mean— I’m honored you’re enjoying it <em>that</em> much.” she comments lightly.</p><p>“Is it that obvious?”</p><p>“Your face is covered on sauce.”</p><p>Vi snorts, “Shit. Sorry.”</p><p>Quickly grabbing a napkin, Vi feels her face get hot.</p><p>“No, it’s fine.” Caitlyn dismisses her, “It’s quite refreshing, actually. My parents were always strict on table manners, it’s a nice change of pace. You’re clearly, uh—<em>devoted</em>. With food, I mean.”</p><p>Vi suppresses a snort. <em>Who the fuck says devoted?</em></p><p>“Yeah, it’s probably a prison thing, although I wasn’t much better as a kid either.”</p><p>Caitlyn blinks, taken aback, “Oh, sorry, I wasn’t trying to—”</p><p>“It’s cool, don’t worry.” Vi dismisses her quickly.</p><p>There’s an awkward silence before Caitlyn opens her mouth again.</p><p>“Are you close to your family?”</p><p>Vi huffs, “As close as anyone can be, considering they’re 6 feet underground.” She replies lightly.</p><p>It clearly doesn’t land as the joke Vi intended it to be, watching Caitlyn’s face morph into an expression of horror.</p><p>“Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t—”</p><p>Vi snaps out of her mind.</p><p>
  <em>God, what is wrong with her?</em>
</p><p>“No, sorry. I’m—you’re being nice to me and I’m being a dick. Sorry.” She scratches the back of her neck awkwardly before looking down.</p><p>This is the exact reason why she doesn’t socialize. She’s already kissing their little food-dynamic goodbye when Caitlyn interrupts.</p><p>“No, it’s completely fine. People usually don’t joke about it, you caught me off-guard.”</p><p>She sighs, “Yeah, well, I’m a full-time comedian, that’s me.” This time, Caitlyn does giggle quietly and Vi counts it as a win, maybe she hasn’t completely fucked this up. “But yeah. They’re dead, basically. Parents, siblings, all that stuff.” She motions with her hand awkwardly.</p><p>“That’s messed up.” She comments quietly. Vi nods along.</p><p>“Mhm, could be worse. It’s fine.”</p><p>It <em>is</em> fine, it’s been fine for almost 8 years, it’s not about to <em>not</em> be fine now.</p><p>“Do you have any siblings?”</p><p>“Nope, I’m an only child.” Caitlyn shakes her head.</p><p>Vi hums, “That makes sense.”</p><p>The blue-haired narrows her eyes, “What is that supposed to mean?” she asks, suspiciously amused.</p><p>“I just knew it. It’s a superpower only people with siblings have.”</p><p>Except Vi doesn’t <em>have</em> any siblings anymore.</p><p>Caitlyn rolls her eyes, “Oh, I get it, I’m not invited to the cool siblings club because I’m an only child. Real mature.”</p><p>“Yep, sorry to break it to you.” She teases back.</p><p>She can’t remember the last time she’s been this friendly to someone <em>and</em> said someone was, in return, nice to her.</p><p>There’s a pause in the air and they both sigh quietly.</p><p>Vi hesitates, “So, I’m not trying to be a dick but it’s getting kind of suspicious how you’re not asking why I’m an ex-con.”</p><p>She tries to play it cool even though a part of her is truly curious to know what the fuck is actually going on.</p><p>Caitlyn blinks, confused.</p><p>“Oh. I just didn’t want to be nosy, I hate it when people try to look into my business. Just figured at some point you’d tell me if you wanted to.” She replies quietly.</p><p>“Yeah, but I could’ve murdered someone and be sitting here like nothing happened.”</p><p>“Have you murdered someone?”</p><p>She stops, “No.”</p><p>“Then what did you do?” her curious tone makes it seem like she’s asking Vi about the weather. It’s… confusing.</p><p>“Nothing. I was accused of something I didn’t do. Didn’t have the money to pay a good lawyer and ended up in jail, it’s kind of a short story.” She’s skipping all the ugly details, all the things that can’t make it past her throat because it <em>hurts</em> too much to say them out loud.</p><p>Caitlyn gasps, “And you were there for 7 years?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s—” Caitlyn frowns, a clear expression of hurt in her face, “I’m so sorry, Vi. That’s terrible.”</p><p>She plays it cool, not her first rodeo on the pity stare. Caitlyn’s face does look much more pained, but maybe she’s just too empathetic for her own good. Vi knew a lot of people like that, before 2796 days happened, and she was left alone. Powder used to be too soft, too kind, Vi had a hard time saying no to her more often than not.</p><p>“It’s fine. I’m mostly surprised you’re so nice. I was expecting you to freak out when I first told you I went to prison.” She jokes lightly.</p><p>Caitlyn snorts, “Right, was it the accent that scared you? Am I too posh?”</p><p>“No, it was the stick up your ass.”</p><p>Caitlyn lets out a loud laugh and Vi joins her. From her place, she can see the little tooth-gap in between her front teeth, more visible now that she’s laughing.</p><p>Caitlyn interrupts first, “I don’t think you give yourself enough credit. You are nice too, prison or not.” And <em>oh</em>, isn’t it quite the lie? Since when do people see her as <em>nice</em>?</p><p>She shakes her head, “I’m not nice, you’re definitely projecting.”</p><p>Caitlyn doesn’t let go of it. “Your face literally lighted up the other day when I knocked on your door to give you the brownies. <em>And</em> you seem awfully peaceful about the fact that you were wrongfully imprisoned for almost a decade.”</p><p><em>I’m not peaceful at all about it</em>, she thinks internally.</p><p>She scoffs, “So what?” hoping Caitlyn won’t catch the way her cheeks are turning pink.</p><p>Caitlyn only looks at her for a second before replying, “You are a good person, you won’t be able to change my mind on that.”</p><p>There’s a void on Vi’s heart, a full stomach and a feeling of dread at the prospect of not knowing how many days have passed since she last heard that.</p><p>She resets the count.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>There’s a lot of things Vi doesn’t know about herself. It’s quite the mystery, all these things she used to remember about her mind, her body, left aside once she was trapped inside a box too small to content her rage. It felt so sudden, the minute she was out in the world, the sky too bright, the rain too loud and the universe too big. It’s overwhelming more often than not, and she’s left wondering how to figure out all these things on her own.</p><p>For instance, she sleepwalks. She’s pretty sure she didn’t do <em>that</em> before, you know, all that’s happened, so it <em>is</em> a bit unsettling.</p><p>It starts with little things, mundane things, like waking up in the bathroom when she was sure she went to sleep on the living room’s floor. You know, the standard.</p><p>Apparently, her sleepwalking self doesn’t have a lot of common sense, hiding her keys under the couch or leaving her cellphone inside the fridge. It’s weird, but she can manage.</p><p>She hopes she doesn’t scream or hit things or shit like that, considering her awaken self still needs to be in good terms with her neighbors.</p><p>As everything else she tries to keep count of it, the sleepwalking thing. 13 days since it’s started, 9 days since she accidentally hit her head with the bathroom door while sleepwalking, 3 days since she folded her clothes (?). She’s got to be fair; her sleepwalking self is actually useful for a few things.</p><p>It’s been 0 days, 0 hours and 4 minutes since she woke up in the middle of one of her sleepwalking sessions to the sound of a glass breaking. She blinks slowly at the sound, not completely sure about why she’s standing in the middle of the kitchen when she’s supposed to be sleeping.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>This is going to be a problem. But hey, when has something in Vi’s life been anything other than that?</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Caitlyn finds new recipes and Vi has the chance to try them all out. She’s been out of prison for 86 days now, met Caitlyn 60 days ago. It’s oddly comforting to keep count on that.</p><p>She’s not close to her family, that’s the latest thing Caitlyn’s told her about herself. Politician mother with high standards Caitlyn could never meet, ended up leaving to become a journalist and doesn’t talk on a daily basis to her mom, who’s mostly disappointed she didn’t follow her path to get into politics.</p><p>“Honestly, I’m surprised you didn’t point it out the first time we met. Everybody else in this building has at some point stopped me to ask me if I was Cassandra Kiramman’s daughter.” Caitlyn comments absent-mindedly. They’re in her apartment again, eating freshly baked croissants (Vi’s still amazed at her talent to bake such tasteful things when she can’t even boil an egg without making a disaster).</p><p>She snorts, “You’re forgetting the fact that not so long ago I was living inside a concrete cell.” She jokes.</p><p>Caitlyn rolls her eyes, “I can’t even imagine how you manage to joke so easily about that.”</p><p>Vi shrugs, “Told you, full-time comedian.” The blue-haired doesn’t bat an eye at the response and Vi sighs. “It’s just easier. To joke about it, I mean.” She ends up saying quietly. Caitlyn hums.</p><p>“I get it. For what it’s worth, I’m here, if you need to talk about it in a non-joking way.” Caitlyn adds softly and Vi can only nod at that, her throat closing around nothing.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>The sleepwalking comes and goes, the nightmares not so much.</p><p>Her mind can barely get the picture of what is happening during her nightmares, the only proof that they’re there is the fact that Vi keeps waking up at ungodly hours with her face covered in tears and her heart running too fast. There’s a sense of loss, of a void inside her and she can’t explain <em>why</em>.</p><p>In contrast with her sleepwalking, which is mostly quietly wandering through her apartment, her nightmares start soft and escalate until they’re loud enough to suffocate her. Vi <em>knows</em> she screams sometimes when she’s having them, even if she can’t remember it, her throat is sore enough to be proof of it.</p><p>And Caitlyn, too. If her being at her door at 2 A.M. means anything.</p><p>“You were screaming. I thought something had happened.” Is the response she gets. Cool, now she’s bothering her neighbors too.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry. Nightmare.” Her eyes are probably red from rubbing them angrily.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Sorry for waking you up.”</p><p>Caitlyn blinks, a hurt expression on her face, “No, it’s fine. Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yep. I’ll probably just stay awake, don’t wanna wake up anybody else.”</p><p>“Would you like me to stay with you?” Caitlyn hesitates before asking.</p><p>Except for the key incident, Caitlyn has never been inside Vi’s apartment. It’s even rich to call it an apartment, only having a cheap couch and a few things of her own. The blanket it’s still splattered on the floor, even if Vi can’t sleep for more than a few hours each night.</p><p>It’s embarrassing compared to Caitlyn’s home and life in general, she’s got her life almost perfectly shaped while Vi is still discovering how to be a human again.</p><p>She’s not… there yet. Not ready.</p><p>Not now, maybe not ever.</p><p>“No, I’m okay.”</p><p>She doesn’t go back to sleep. It’s fine.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She’s not okay but Caitlyn seems to catch the message that Vi doesn’t want her help.</p><p>They keep sharing cookies and overall, everything keeps being kind of the same in their interactions.</p><p>Vi can tell Caitlyn’s hesitant to ask her about how she’s doing, if she’s sleeping better. She does her best to ignore those glances.</p><p>It’s easy for a few weeks until they’re back again in the same scenario as before.</p><p>This time, Caitlyn seems more worried, frowning as she knocks on her door in the middle of the night. And Vi’s mind has been breaking by bits, letting herself go when she’s feeling this unmoored, from times to times.</p><p>It’s the reason why now, when Caitlyn offers her to stay again, she agrees.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>It’s all she can manage.</p><p>Caitlyn (thankfully) doesn’t comment on Vi’s lack of, well, anything and just sits on the couch awkwardly waiting for Vi to do the same. The silence fills the room along with their breathings.</p><p>“What was the nightmare about?” she asks quietly. They’re sitting close enough to not need to be loud.</p><p>“I can’t remember.”</p><p>Caitlyn nods, “It’s okay, I get those sometimes.” There’s a pause, a sigh, “When I first left my parents’ house, I had a lot of trouble sleeping since I wasn’t used to being alone.”</p><p>Vi looks up, “Mhm. Do you miss being close to them?”</p><p>“Sometimes. Sometimes not. I like having my own space, but it was hard at first. Adjusting, I mean.”</p><p>She scoffs, “Tell me about it. I’m still sleeping on the floor because the bed is too fucking soft.”</p><p>Caitlyn looks down, “I was wondering why there was a blanket on the floor. Guess that explains it.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She snorts, sobering up after a few seconds, “Me and my little sister used to sleep on the same bed when she was really young. After she— after I got out of prison I just couldn’t stand to sleep on a bed, it brings back old memories.” She ends up whispering.</p><p>Caitlyn hums quietly, thinking. “Well, I never had the privilege to sleep on the floor.” She mimics for Vi to get up. She frowns, confused, as Caitlyn lays down on the floor.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“Helping you go back to sleep before you decide to become an owl and never sleep again.” She pats the space next to her.</p><p>“Owls <em>do</em> sleep, you know? They just don't sleep at night. It's not the same thing.”</p><p>“My point still stands.”</p><p>Vi rolls her eyes before settling next to her, awkwardly moving her limbs until most of her body isn’t hurting. Caitlyn does the same, laying on her side to face her. they stay in silence for a few minutes and Vi squirms, trying to ignore the obvious presence of another human being on her space.</p><p>“Close your eyes. Try to sleep at least for a bit.” She whispers and the Vi feels a prickle on the back of her neck. She lets herself fall and the void catches her.</p><p>She can’t remember how many days have passed since she last felt this safe.</p><p>She resets the count.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Part II</strong>
</p><p>Tuesday.</p><p>Vi’s been out of prison for 103 days now, 95 days since she’s started working at The Last Drop, 2973 since she last saw her family alive and breathing.</p><p>2 days since she last showered and she’s yet to go out grocery shopping this week.</p><p>Met Caitlyn 77 days ago, hasn’t talked to her for 5 days now.</p><p>It’s rather pathetic. Not so long ago, she was showering next to a bunch of strangers and wouldn’t even bat an eye at seeing someone else’s tits or weird birthmarks (seriously, what was wrong with inmate 267’s hairy mole?), but now she can’t face her neighbor, just because.</p><p>Deep down she knows it’s childish and ‘just because’ doesn’t count as an excuse but she’s…</p><p>How do you phrase it?</p><p>Ashamed?</p><p>Embarrassed?</p><p>Humiliated?</p><p>Is it even possible for Vi to feel like that? To experience anything but constant emptiness?</p><p>Apparently, yes.</p><p>Once upon a time Vi had been a scrawny kid with way too much rage inside of her, being contained in a human size’s cage. Almost 30 days into prison, she ended up getting into a fight during shower time which resulted in 478 massively kicking her ass because Vi thought of herself as invincible.</p><p>That was humiliating.</p><p>Being able to sleep for 7 hours straight after years, thanks to your way too sweet and polite neighbor who offered to sleep next to you (should she also clarify that there was no mattress involved since Vi’s still too fucked up to get even close to an actual bed?) after you had a nightmare that waked her up in the middle of the night, staying there during the whole to make sure you weren’t cold or had another nightmare?</p><p>It's hands down utter <em>horror</em>.</p><p>There is no going around with it, maybe she should just, steal a bag of gummies, punch a guy or two and go back to jail where the limits are <em>clear</em> and there aren’t people like Caitlyn who’ll make Vi feel things she thought she wouldn’t be able to experiment anymore.</p><p>The whole thing it’s even more terrible because Caitlyn didn’t seem the least bothered when being tasked to be Vi’s literal sleeping buddy. She can’t even grasp the idea of someone being so pure to not fucking comment on your neighbor’s fucked up sleeping schedule (and life).</p><p>So, she doesn’t bother with formalities; the moment Caitlyn’s out the door the next morning, Vi decides she’s not going to talk to her ever again. It seems cruel, considering Caitlyn’s sleepy face with the small smile decorating her lips while she asks Vi if she’s slept okay, but it’s necessary. It’s a sacrifice she’s willing to do, in order to keep the tiny bits of dignity she has left.</p><p>Caitlyn rings her doorbell once, twice, and Vi is casually <em>not</em> there. Not on Mondays nor Tuesdays. Not ever. </p><p>It's been 5 days since the uh, <em>incident </em>and Vi’s doing great.</p><p>Except she hasn’t been able to sleep for more than a few minutes and the leftovers inside her fridge are no longer attractive to her appetite, considering she had gotten used to Caitlyn’s vast collection of recipes.</p><p>It’s fine, there are a lot of things that have been fine in her life for years. Just one more thing to add to the list, one more thing to keep count on, one more thing to <em>miss</em> so desperately.</p><p>Maybe she’s not doing fine.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She doesn’t make it to day 7 when Caitlyn approaches her while entering the elevator. The doors are already closing when a loud sudden <em>hey! </em>and Vi (why? literally <em>why</em> does she do that?) puts her left arm in between the closing gap to let the person in.</p><p>Said person turns out to be Caitlyn.</p><p>This was probably premeditated by her. Like murder, but worse.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>She makes a non-committal noise in return and Caitlyn’s face falls slightly. She recovers fast enough.</p><p>The silence is getting louder and more and more awkward by each second and Vi has the distinctive feeling of needing to run, which is… quite impossible in this specific panorama. </p><p>“About the other day—” Caitlyn starts.</p><p>The light flickers and the elevator suddenly shudders to a stop.</p><p>Power goes out, leaving them in pitch darkness. The silence is deafening, broken only by their quickened breaths as they stand there, surrounded by stillness.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Caitlyn breaks the silence first.</p><p>“Well, I didn’t shit my pants, so.” It comes out as a kind of a squeal, not completely mature of her. If she’s being fair, it’s not exactly soothing to be trapped inside this very small and very dark place.</p><p>And <em>oh</em>, is she breathing too fast? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe she’s not breathing at all. The air feels thinner, coming by tiny bits into her chest even if she clearly is opening her mouth big enough to get more oxygen inside her lungs.</p><p>She’s not even sure on <em>what</em> she is choking. The shadows start deforming until all she can see is a blur.</p><p>She hasn’t been in a dark place in <em>so</em> long, she’s already getting accustomed to having the light on at night.</p><p>She really shouldn’t have taken the elevator this morning, let alone move into this building to try and live a normal life, she should be somewhere else, she–</p><p>There’s a really urgent voice inside her head that screams <em>this is not the place to have a panic attack</em>, especially considering someone else’s in here.</p><p>Caitlyn seems to sense it too, slowly getting closer until she can reach Vi’s shoulder and motions for her to sit on the floor. She’s pretty sure she mutters something close to <em>don’t touch me</em>, and even if it comes out breathless, borderline scared, Caitlyn instantly removes her hand.</p><p>“Vi? Take a deep breath.” Her voice sounds far away in Vi’s head. She ignores it in order to take a big fucking gulp of air before she passes out due to the lack of oxygen. She presses her head loudly against the wall of the elevator, closing her eyes.</p><p>She’s vaguely conscious that Caitlyn is sitting in front of her, probably frowning or doing any other expression associated with concern. Of all the people she could’ve been trapped inside an elevator with, this is probably the safest option, although she’d rather not be in here with anyone.</p><p>Scratch that, she’d rather be able to breathe properly.</p><p>By some miracle she manages to get heart to stop beating so fast after a few minutes. The silence she is met with is quite awkward, as she slowly starts breathing normally.</p><p>She hears the shift of Caitlyn’s movement next to her.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>She hums in agreement, still out of breath. “This is now the smallest place I’ve ever been confined to. Guess I’ve broke down another record, yay for me.” She adds, sarcastically.</p><p>Caitlyn doesn’t laugh. Again, though crowd.</p><p>She clutches to the cloth of her pants, needing to grip her hand around <em>something</em>. Maybe count to 10. Scream. Cry. Whatever her body feels up to.</p><p>“I’m okay, don’t worry.”</p><p>Caitlyn doesn’t seem to buy it, meditating her answer.</p><p>“We’ll be fine, it has happened to me before. It usually just takes a couple minutes to start again. You’ll be fine.”</p><p>There’s a weird shift in the air, waiting for the fucking thing to start working again.</p><p>Vi’s not very optimistic, she may as well start keeping count on it, how long can it take? 7 days? 105? 2975? What’s time anyways, if not something that hasn’t destroyed her, rotted her from the inside since the minute her family stopped breathing.</p><p>A distraction would be really nice right now.</p><p>“Listen, about the other day—” Caitlyn starts, quietly.</p><p>Mhm. Never mind.</p><p>“What about it.” Vi cuts her off dismissively. Caitlyn startles at her response and Vi feels like an asshole.</p><p>Caitlyn seems to hesitate, wondering what to say next, “I know you’ve been avoiding me.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“Yes, you are. You won’t talk to me.”</p><p>“I’m talking to you now.”</p><p>Caitlyn blinks and she barely catches it through the dark.</p><p>“Vi, you can’t even look at me.”</p><p>She doesn’t dignify with a response to that.</p><p>“And I get it, if I made you uncomfortable in any way—”</p><p>“You didn’t.”</p><p>“Then why did you suddenly stop talking to me?” she sounds borderline desperate.</p><p>“I am talking to you now, aren’t I?”</p><p>Caitlyn scoffs angrily, “Oh, very mature.”</p><p>They’re sitting across from each other as time passes, Vi feels weirdly familiar with this setting, being cornered once again.</p><p>The blue-haired sighs and swallows loudly before opening her mouth.</p><p>“If what you wish is for me to stop talking to you then I’ll respect it, but I would like to at least know where I went wrong.” She ends up saying quietly.</p><p>And Vi could literally smash her own head against the floor, at this point she doesn’t know if Caitlyn is being purposely oblivious or just plain stupid. She covers her eyes with her left arm, trying to scratch the guilt off herself.</p><p>“You didn’t do anything wrong, I’m just—” she cuts herself.</p><p><em>Just what? </em>The voice inside her head aggressively asks.</p><p>“Just what?” Caitlyn asks, gently.</p><p>“I didn’t want you to see that, it’s weird. I’m weird.” She squeaks out, barely.</p><p>The silence only prolongs and Vi can’t take back what she said. The elevator could start running again so she can finally get out and bury herself alive in the nearest cemetery.</p><p>Caitlyn breaks it first.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>She scoffs, “Why are you sorry? I was the one to make things weird.”</p><p>“No, I—” Caitlyn seems at a loss of words, “I thought I was helping you, I didn’t mean to make you feel like that.” She replies apologetically.</p><p>“You didn’t make me feel anything I didn’t already feel about myself.” She tries miserably to stop Caitlyn from blaming herself for being too caring.</p><p>“You shouldn’t feel weird for something you can’t control about yourself. It’s the same for me with the stress dealing and the enormous amounts of baking and you don’t make me feel weird about it.”</p><p>Vi sighs, desperate, “It’s not the same.”</p><p>“How is it not the same?” Caitlyn shrugs, “Unless you <em>do</em> think I’m weird for doing it, in that case I’m screwed.” She snorts quietly, trying to lighten up the mood. Vi doesn’t feel like it.</p><p>“You sleep on a bed and have a normal, human-like schedule. It’s not the same.”</p><p>“Yes, but I also wasn’t locked up for half my life.”</p><p>Vi hums, still avoiding her gaze.</p><p>“Just to clarify, I don’t think it’s weird. In fact, I don’t think <em>anything</em> about it. I just wanted to help you, I wasn’t trying to make you feel worse about it.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” She mimics with her right hand, dismissing it.</p><p>“It’s also okay if it isn’t fine.” Caitlyn adds wisely. Vi used to <em>sort of</em> envy her capacity to be so chill about everything, at least when they had first met. No wonder her only weird hobby is literally baking, Vi wishes she could be <em>that</em> normal about stressful situations. She’s not, but Caitlyn doesn’t seem bothered by it.</p><p>When she doesn’t say anything, Caitlyn adds:</p><p>“I would like for us to keep talking, if you’d want that. You haven’t had the chance to try out this new recipe I found to make lemon pie.”</p><p>Vi ignores the sudden urge to cry at how easy things are when Caitlyn’s involved. “I’d like that too.” She whispers, “Sorry for being a dick and uh, everything that happened after.”</p><p>She can tell Caitlyn is probably smiling, satisfied. “It’s already forgiven.”</p><p>The light flickers back to life and so does something inside Vi’s chest.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Lemon pie fucking rocks.</p><p>And so does the apple crumble and the chocolate cookies.</p><p>She’s actually invited to participate in the making of the last one, one of those weekends where Vi isn’t busy and Caitlyn is way too excited to let her wait until they’re fresh out of the oven.</p><p>The whole process turns out to be quite entertaining, in Vi’s opinion. Caitlyn hums while mixing the ingredients and Vi feels a little guilty at the realization that, even if the cookies turn out to be fucking gross, she would smile her way out of it just to see Caitlyn smile.</p><p>Of course, the cookies taste amazing as everything else Caitlyn’s ever baked and they’re sitting in her kitchen, trying them out while still warm.</p><p>“Why cupcakes?” she breaks the silence first. Caitlyn frowns.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“The second time you knocked on my door, why cupcakes?”</p><p>“Oh.” Caitlyn giggles and her cheeks turn a light shade of pink, “They were actually meant to be a gift for my boss. His wife and him had had a baby recently and I wanted to congratulate him. I just thought I could bake something sweet, but they ended up being too sugary and I had to look for another recipe.”</p><p>Vi hums in agreement, “Too bad, they were perfect in my opinion.”</p><p>Caitlyn smiles, “I had a hunch you’d had a sweet tooth.”</p><p>“Let me guess, the piercings gave it away?” she teases.</p><p>“Nope. The pink hair.”</p><p>She snorts.</p><p>“Out of the two of us, <em>you</em> are the one with the sweet tooth, not me.” Vi adds.</p><p>“I’m not.” Caitlyn scoffs.</p><p>“Yes, you are. Your house could turn into a bakery. I should start calling you something to honor it. Cupcake has a nice ring to it.”</p><p>“You’re the one who eats it all, not me.”</p><p>Vi chokes down on her cookie, placing a hand to her chest, a hurtful expression plastered on her face, “I’m sorry for wanting to boost up your ego, next time I’ll make sure to decline any offer.”</p><p>Caitlyn giggles and Vi uses the little time she has to appreciate her tooth-gap once again (and <em>God</em>, why is she so pretty?).</p><p>It’s been 0 days, 0 hours and 15 minutes since Vi’s stomach has been stuffed up with chocolate cookies. There are a few things good in this life, to keep count on.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She stops saving her money and starts using it. Life goes on and Vi is trying to slowly ease herself into the wave of it. Very slowly.</p><p>She buys a new TV, clothes, shoes and books an appointment to pierce her eyebrow. She’s always wanted to have that piercing, and now that she’s out, she has bigger chances to get it done without the risk of an infection. Her first piercing, the one from her nose, had taken ages to properly heal, mostly due to poor hygienical conditions. And, like, a lot of blood covering it most of the time. She is proud to say that the other guys had been left with no piercing at all after she kicked the hell out of them, so, worth it.</p><p>Caitlyn suggests plants, so Vi buys plants.</p><p>And a coffee machine.</p><p>And stuffed socks. The ones that prevent her feet from getting cold. She hates the cold.</p><p>They’re all objective, useful things. She has a hard time spending money on herself at first, until she realizes there are a lot of helpful things that aren’t selfish of herself to buy.</p><p>Like this book full of recipes that she saw on sale the other day, the type that Caitlyn would buy if she saw it herself. So, she ends up getting it for her as a gift for all the things she’s done for Vi.</p><p>It’s probably the thing she feels the less guilty about buying, because it’s not for <em>her</em> but for someone else. Someone who has made her feel better an awful bunch of times now. Caitlyn deserves it, and Vi’s left with something worth much more than money; seeing her smile when she opens the bag and sees the book inside of it.</p><p>The new bedsheets are left inside the shopping bag. She’ll get there eventually.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She’s outside Caitlyn’s apartment.</p><p>Building courage, that’s it. Just like when she used to get into fights. It’s all about anticipation.</p><p>She has this vivid sense of feeling some sort of déjà vu; how Powder used to be small for her age, at only 8 years old making her way into Vi’s bed at night when it was raining so loud, she would get scared. Vi’s muscles had learned to read those signals even when asleep and she’d embrace her gently until she was no longer afraid.</p><p>Now, she’s outside someone else’s door and Vi’s no kid but she is, in fact, a little close to feeling scared. Storms used to be the one thing that would get her lulled to sleep, the sound of the soft rain against her window. She didn’t know being confined inside a cell too deep onto the floor to hear <em>anything</em> for 7 years would make her get scared and the sound of lightning storms. She just needs to get used to it, like everything else.</p><p>But right now, she’s… not fucking facing <em>it</em> at all. It’s probably why she’s building up the courage to knock on Caitlyn’s door to, whatever, have company.</p><p>Her fist ends up being unused when there’s a sudden movement and Caitlyn’s literally there, startled to see Vi looking like a wet puppy outside her door.</p><p>“Oh! Hey, I was about to knock down your door. I made chicken.”</p><p>Their little arrangement started branching out, from Caitlyn inviting Vi over for dinner more frequently to Vi managing to make a deal with Benzo to take home a bunch of junk food that Caitlyn denies enjoying even though she’s clearly devoted to the French fries Benzo cooks (Vi has never seen her eat something with so much happiness).</p><p>They eat in a comfortable silence, Caitlyn mostly humming to herself while Vi activates the vacuum cleaner inside of her system to inhale the chicken. She stops to drink water when a thunder strikes the sky, and she ends up splashing water all over herself.</p><p>“Fuck! <em>Shit</em>, sorry.”</p><p>“You okay?” Caitlyn frowns, concerned. She hands over the paper towels.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry. Scared the shit out of me. Sorry.” Caitlyn waves a hand dismissively, “It’s the fucking noise, I’m not used to it.”</p><p>She hums, acknowledging the information. She has her thinking face on, the one she uses when Vi starts talking about one of her many weirds habits.</p><p>“Would you want me to turn on the TV?” Caitlyn offers hesitantly.</p><p>She shrugs, “Sure, why not.”</p><p>Caitlyn ends up putting the kids channel which is honestly embarrassing until SpongeBob starts and Vi forgets why she was even bothered in the first place. Seriously, that dude is fucking amazing.</p><p>There’s something wandering through her mind, bugging her to remember when was the last time she saw this show with Powder when they were little.</p><p>Where there should be a feeling of her chest turning too tight to breath, there’s only a vague sense of nostalgia. She’s missed this, just as much as her.</p><p>Her attention snaps back at Caitlyn when she feels her sitting down on the other side.</p><p>“I used to watch this a lot. With my sister, I mean.”</p><p>“Younger or older?”</p><p>“Younger.”</p><p>Caitlyn hums.</p><p>“She was the one that would get scared at thunderstorms when we were little, she used to sneak up into my bed. When she—” she clears her throat, <em>nope, still can't say it out loud</em>, “I was okay with it, until I went to prison and I couldn’t hear anything from the inside, turns out it’s fucking loud when you’re not used to it.”</p><p>Caitlyn nods in understanding, “I hated thunderstorms as a kid too. Your sister was lucky to have you.” She adds softly, genuine.</p><p>Her throat closes at the thought, and she can only nod.</p><p>Turns out, Caitlyn’s couch is actually very nice and warm and before Vi knows, she’s falling into the spiral of sleep.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She scribbles down the meaning of the few plants she owns, just because they’re nice.</p><p>Her little bonsai, the one placed up the kitchen aisle means harmony. And calm.</p><p>The cactus in her living room means protection. Good meaning, too.</p><p>‘Loyalty and endurance’ is the succulent’s thing.</p><p>String of hearts symbolizes love.</p><p>It’s all the kind of feelings she enjoys having.</p><p>Some of them, she <em>wants</em> to feel.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>There’s a knock on Vi’s door, followed by the sight of Caitlyn’s teary eyes.</p><p>“Hey, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Caitlyn sniffles, “Sorry, it’s been a day. Would you mind if I just—” she gestures to the inside of the apartment.</p><p>It sort of revives something inside of her close to muscle memory, she knows how to take care and she likes to feel needed by the people around her. Some things never truly change and Vi’s here again, yet to know the reason for Caitlyn’s hurt.</p><p>“I talked to my mom today over the phone. It’s been a while, that’s all.” Is what Caitlyn ends up saying.</p><p>Ah. Not entirely Vi’s field, but she’ll manage.</p><p>“What did you two talk about?”</p><p>Caitlyn hesitates, “You, actually. I hadn’t had many friends over the last few years, I told her about you.”</p><p>Vi feels slightly honored to be mentioned, even if it means that somehow, she has higher risks to end up getting publicly executed if she accidentally crosses the wrong path with Caitlyn’s mom, but she’ll accept the sacrifice.</p><p>“Hm, why not?”</p><p>The blue-haired blinks, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Just, it doesn’t sound like you to not have many friends. You were pretty friendly to me now and then, and I’m a dick to everybody ninety percent of the time. I figured you’re easy to get along with.”</p><p>Caitlyn snorts, “People have, uh, strong opinions. About me and my family. Mostly my family.”</p><p>She rolls her eyes, “So, what? They tell you to fuck off just because of your mom’s career?”</p><p>“Basically.”</p><p>Vi scoffs, “You normal people are so weird. I’d literally be friends with anyone who offered me cupcakes the second time we met.”</p><p>Caitlyn giggles, “Oh, believe me, I tried. The only neighbor aside from you who accepted my baking was the old lady from the first floor. The rest of them straight up told me to shove the politics propaganda up my ass.”</p><p>Vi whistles, “Damn.”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>They both sigh loudly.</p><p>“You know what? Fuck them. I get to try all the things you bake and those assholes are probably having miserable lives while we get to eat a bunch of sugar. Their loss.”</p><p>Caitlyn snorts, “At this rate you’re going to end up in the hospital for consuming to much sugar.”</p><p>Vi rolls her eyes, “Who cares?”</p><p>“Me, Vi. I care.”</p><p>“Then stop feeding me sugar!”</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>According to Caitlyn, the sleepwalking thing is funny, once she gets to experience it first-hand.</p><p>They’re at Vi’s apartment again, this time with a bigger blanket and a more willingly feeling from her to try and sleep for a full night. Caitlyn is there as her emotional support human. Kind of.</p><p>It’s mostly a chaos; she ends up running the shower while sleepwalking and Caitlyn has to stop her from trying to move the couch to the other side of the living room. She waters a plant.</p><p>It’s not like she can remember anything the next morning, but she trusts Caitlyn to be telling the truth.</p><p>In all honesty, Vi’s more interested in the fact that she got a full night of sleep uninterrupted. It’s been now 0 days, 13 hours and 34 minutes since she’s felt well rested.</p><p>It’s quite comforting.</p><p>The whole sleeping in a bed deal it’s… still in process. She does buy a new pillow even though it goes unused, mostly as a reminder of something she might achieve at some point.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Her memory starts to falter, and Vi’s objective reaction is to panic.</p><p>The days get mixed up and she doesn’t know how long it has been since she last took the trash out or when was the last time she ever hugged Mylo or Claggor.</p><p>So, she starts scribbling it down.</p><p>It feels weird, not to be able to relay on her memory like she’s used to, but it’s at least something.</p><p>
  <em>3015 days since she last hugged her family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>3011 days since she went to prison. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>1645 days since she got the tattoo on her back.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>1004 days since she turned 20 years old in prison.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>256 days since she got her trial.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>133 days since she got out of prison.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>107 days since she met Caitlyn.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>34 days since she tried to sleep on her bed (the experiment was a total failure, must be tried again in at least a week from now).</em>
</p><p>
  <em>15 days since she hugged Caitlyn. (This last one is purely observational and not meant to be something too important to keep count on)</em>
</p><p>It works for a while, and it lets Vi’s mind at ease.</p><p>Until Caitlyn finds it.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>“I mean, I think it’s kind of cute that you keep count on when was the last time you hugged me.”</p><p>Vi’s facing down the couch, Caitlyn sitting next to her which is <em>not</em> comforting her at all. It’s embarrassing.</p><p>“It is weird, you can say it.” She even <em>sounds</em> pathetic. She hasn’t felt this ashamed since Mylo accidentally found out Vi had a crush on a girl from senior year. And she was 12 at that time. She’s too old for this.</p><p>“It’s not weird.”</p><p>She groans, it ends up coming all muffled from her face being splattered against the couch. Caitlyn giggles.</p><p>She knows sometimes she spirals into dramatic rants. She realizes she’s doing it when Caitlyn giggles, it’s the way she learns how to detect them. Usually when things are serious Caitlyn detects it too, like that one time they decided to go out for a walk around the park and a child started screaming very loudly and <em>very</em> clearly in pain, the type of pain Vi hates to relive. They were out of there in a matter of seconds.</p><p>“I didn’t know the tattoo extended to your whole back.” She comments lightly. Summer had hit pretty quickly, and she went back to wearing tank tops. Until now, Caitlyn had only seen the gears inked into both her arms.</p><p>“Yep. Hurt like a bitch. I am proud of it, though.”</p><p>Caitlyn hums absent-mindedly. Vi’s mind keeps being on the static station and she can’t seem to stop it. She feels like there’s a lot of things happening all at once and she can’t control any of them.</p><p>“I’m starting to forget things. I used to keep count on things with my mind, now I can’t do it anymore.” She ends up whispering, frowning at the prospect of just, <em>forgetting</em>. She feels almost guilty to admit it out loud, like it’s going to end up making it more real.</p><p>“I think you need to give your mind a little rest, Vi. It’s going to take a while.”</p><p>She sighs, “I don’t <em>need</em> rest, I need to remember.”</p><p>There’s a shift next to her, Caitlyn positioning her body horizontally until she’s mirroring Vi’s body on the other side of the couch. One of her hands reaches her left arm and squeezes it, in attempt to comfort her.</p><p>"Would a hug make you feel better?"</p><p>"... I don't know." She whispers, hesitant. She's not sure if there's anything that could make her feel less miserable right now. But Caitlyn is <em>offering</em>, and Vi always has a hard time <em>asking</em> and she's still getting used to having someone close again, at least close enough to want to hug her. "Maybe." She adds after a few seconds. </p><p>Slowly, an arm crosses her torso and the blue-haired gets closer, leaning her body lightly to press onto Vi's side until she's sort of but not really cuddling her.</p><p>... Yeah, well, it sort of is cuddling. Which is nice, because she's warm and Vi really appreciates not needing to say out loud when she needs to be held, even if it doesn't happen very often. </p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>In an attempt to regain her capacity to memorize every single thing that has ever happened to her, she starts therapy. Partially Caitlyn’s idea; she had suggested it as a plan B, in case Vi would start <em>actually</em> forgetting things due to her own head processing trauma.</p><p>She does not recover her massive memory. Instead, she’s left with a lot to unpack, thanks to her therapist. Turns out it’s not healthy to bottle up everything, psychologically speaking.</p><p>It’s not exactly nice to talk over and over about the things that hurt, but maybe it is part of the whole adapting process.</p><p>Good news is, apparently, she <em>can</em> be fixed (her therapist winces every time Vi calls it ‘fixing’ but what else is she supposed to call it?) mostly through weekly sessions and talking, which is… nice. She was starting to believe she would have to factory reset herself at some point.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>“I feel weird.”</p><p>Her whole body feels tense against the bed, even though she’s laying in the softest of places. Both hands resting at her sides, she stares at the ceiling. Meditating what her reaction is going to be.</p><p>Caitlyn hums, lying next to her, visibly more comfortable and relaxed than Vi. She doesn’t exactly remember how they ended up in this scenario, sometimes Caitlyn just tags along for support. It’s quite helpful.</p><p>“Weird how?” she asks curiously.</p><p>“Like I’m— I don’t know. I don’t like it.” It’s vague. And explains absolutely nothing.</p><p>“Like you’re going to fall into it?” she provides.</p><p>
  <em>How does she always know?</em>
</p><p>“Sort of.” She sighs, “Also makes me hurt my back.”</p><p>Caitlyn hums.</p><p>She can’t stand it anymore. As if her body had its own will, she gets up quickly and gets as far away from the bed as possible, like it’s burning her bones.</p><p>“Sorry, maybe next time.”</p><p>The blue-haired nods happily, looking at her watch.</p><p>“We made it into 49 minutes, that’s new record.”</p><p>Vi snorts.</p><p>“Yay for me.”</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>She learns to detect the things that trigger her mind the wrong way. She makes a list and keeps it close, in case new things become part of those signs.</p><p>Dark spaces, small places, sharp noises.</p><p>Gray light, canes, cold.</p><p>Car horns, ambulance sirens, needles, stuffed toys (not <em>all</em> of them, just… the ones that are bunny-shaped), children screaming, orange juice, TV static, thunderstorms, elevators, foggy days-</p><p>It’s… a lot.</p><p>And it seems endless.</p><p>Her therapist takes a quick look at it and nods, pleased.</p><p>The real problem comes with the next assignment.</p><p>“Now make a list of things that are soothing for you. That make you feel comfortable and at ease.”</p><p>It’s a completely different story. According to her therapist there are no rules on what makes her feel one way or the other, Vi just needs to feel and that’s it. No guidelines.</p><p>It’s a lot more difficult without any parameter. She starts with stupid things.</p><p>Plants, for example. They are pretty stupid things if she’s objective. But they’re very green and very calm. So, she scribbles it down.</p><p>Chocolate cookies too. And banana bread.</p><p>Also having a routine feels very much safe-y. Schedules and plans and knowing what is going to happen, when is going to happen. Calendars are useful for that. She has a strict schedule on everything that happens from Mondays to Sundays, work hours and when to eat, how many times a week she should water her plants. 10 minutes each day for shower time and at least 2 hours a week to spend at Caitlyn’s.</p><p>Caitlyn’s apartment, Caitlyn’s kitchen, Caitlyn’s vanilla cookies.</p><p>Caitlyn.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>So, there is something Vi needs to keep count on from now on.</p><p>But it’s…</p><p>How the fuck does she transcribe it to words on paper?</p><p>The whole thing with trying to sleep on an actual bed will have to wait because now all of her attention is focused on another bigger, important task.</p><p>She kissed Caitlyn, and Caitlyn kissed her back. Or Caitlyn kissed her and Vi kissed back? It’s kind of a blur. Dizzy, even.</p><p>Yes, that’s how she felt, dizzy. In a good way, a very good way. They were supposed to be baking lemon cookies at Caitlyn’s kitchen when it happened. Vi can’t remember who leaned in first, maybe it was mutual, who knows?</p><p>All she knows is that Caitlyn’s mouth tasted like sugar and lemon juice which is exactly what Vi has pictured in her head when imagining that moment. The aftermath of it, being able to see her turn a light shade of pink and giggle nervously like a teenager was probably Vi’s favorite part to replay in her head.</p><p>Internally, she thinks she hasn’t <em>existed</em> this immensely in her whole life.</p><p>And it’s only been 0 days, 2 hours and 29 minutes. Should she wait 21 hours and 31 minutes to write it down and start keeping count of it? Maybe.</p><p>It’s honestly hard to spiral down the panic aisle since Caitlyn is lying next to her on the blanket. Not too much space to start having an existential crisis.</p><p>“Was it okay that I kissed you?” Caitlyn whispers.</p><p>“Yeah.” That’s what she answers because it <em>was</em> fine. It’s probably the first thing in Vi’s life that has actually been <em>fine </em>and not some sort of <em>not fine, but you’ll get used to it</em>.</p><p>Even better, if Caitlyn is still here, there’s a chance she might get to kiss her again. Or get kissed. Both options are fine, she’ll take them both. One at a time or simultaneously.</p><p>Point is, it’s fine.</p><p>There’s an arm passing around her middle and a warm presence settling in the crook of her neck. Silk, blue hair invades her vision as the sleepiness inside of her starts crawling back. Her mind turns off.</p><p>She’ll get time to panic later.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p> There’s no panic later on, just a bunch of chaos on Vi’s little mental note.</p><p>
  <em> <strike>2 days since she last kissed Caitlyn.</strike> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strike>1 day since she last kissed Caitlyn.</strike> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strike>2 hours since she last kissed Caitlyn.</strike> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strike>30 minutes since she last</strike> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strike>3 minutes since she</strike> </em>
</p><p>After that, she stops writing it down. It’s a waste of paper.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Sometimes, it’s the other way around and she learns the things that trigger Caitlyn. Not like, <em>literally</em> trigger, but more of no-no things that should be avoided.</p><p>Her mother is probably at the top of the list (imaginary list, since Caitlyn insists that Vi doesn’t need to keep such a strict leash on those things). Her dad doesn’t count, Caitlyn is quite fond of him despite her mother’s clear influence.</p><p>High school is a sore topic, childhood too. Caitlyn tells Vi about it either way. Says it makes her feel better.</p><p>Carrot cake is her only true enemy, the one that should be avoided at any costs and Vi do needs to check on. Allergies are shit.</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>“Hm, let’s do it.”</p><p>It’s like an old cowboy movie. The ones she used to watch on TV with Powder when they were little.</p><p>Vi (unwillingly) vs. bed. That’s it.</p><p>Caitlyn offered herself as the referee (cuddling companion) for the task.</p><p>Her legs won’t cooperate, watching the enemy from afar.</p><p>“Or I could crash on your couch again.” She suggests.</p><p>Caitlyn doesn’t bat an eye.</p><p>“Vi, you haven’t even tried it yet.”</p><p>“I don’t like those sheets.” She tries again, petulant.</p><p>“<em>You</em> bought those sheets.”</p><p>An undignified noise comes out of her mouth, close to a whine. Caitlyn puts her thinking face on.</p><p>“Listen, just try to lay down for a few minutes, if you start feeling weird, we’ll move onto the couch. I’ll scratch your head until you fall asleep.”</p><p>She hesitates. The couch is still her favorite place to fall asleep, beds are overrated.</p><p>“Okay, deal.”</p><p>The whole process ends up being more boring than she had expected but she does get under the covers, and she has the bonus of Caitlyn laying down next to her with a hand running through her scalp.</p><p>Her eyes start to get heavy without notice and she has the vague feeling that tomorrow she’ll need to scribble down a few things.</p><p>0 days, 0 hours and 0 minutes.</p></div>
