  <em>
    <span>When Vi first met Caitlyn it was as though the storm in her life had been pacified by her serene nature.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Vi was learning about the new college campus in a new city.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Powder tagged along. And together they roamed the entrance of the courtyard, wondering why so much space was wasted on fancy brick walkways, trees and bushes. It was nice to look at, sure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Powder made a joke about her doing a free artwork on the walls to liven it up, </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi laughed and pulled Powder along towards her dorm hall. All women for now. The way Vander appreciated it. But Vi knew that would get old quick. She could barely handle Powder for a week at a time. Let alone a dorm full of them (alphas, omegas, and betas alike) it didn’t matter. Vi hardly had the patience for herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her room was nice anyway. Fifth floor and one side appeared to be already claimed. Pristine, perfect, single bed had too many pillows. The walls had only a few things hung up. All Enforcer memorabilia. On the bedside table was a photo of a freaking rifle!</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What kind of freak am I rooming with?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sheesh, you bunking with a military brat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi looked around the room and sighed, "Well, at least I can have an inside man in case I decide to blow this joint—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who are you?" A posh voice called out from the hallway behind them. “I don’t believe they allow children in the dorms.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi turned around and met the inquisitive stare of a pompous omega, wearing glasses that appeared too large for her youthful face. She glared at both of them. Judgemental curiosity reflected back.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Great.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s my sister.” Vi stepped in front of her sister, feeling territorial. Protective. “Who are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The omega was holding a rather large box filled with all kinds of trinkets. “What are you doing here?” She asked instead. “This is my room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yours?” The older teen whispered under her breath, before walking into the room and dropped the box on her desk with a loud grunt. “Your room, of course. Forgive my manners. I assumed you were… someone else.” The girl wiped her hands on her skirt while watching Vi and Powder. “I’m Caitlyn Kiramman. This is my first year at the Academy. My first year not being home-schooled, actually.” she nervously adjusted her glasses. “I had hoped to make a positive impression, and perhaps, failed in the process.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi frowned, immediately recognizing the name.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Holy shit! You’re rooming with the chairman’s daughter?!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Powder whispered a little too loud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn chuckled halfheartedly. “Retired as of last year actually, so I’m the daughter of no one. Well, I mean, I still have parents. But not important anymore—I–I mean my mother’s important to me obviously but she’s no longer chairman. They’re still alive. But they’re not here. Well, of course they wouldn’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>here</span>
  </em>
  <span> here as I live in the dorms and they live downtown near the Engines of Commerce.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi raised a brow at the rambling. “Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Damn, good luck.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Powder whispered while quietly ducking out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi looked over the nervous omega and grinned warmly. The nerdy librarian look was actually kinda cute—depends on the alcohol consumption and Vi could find this woman attractive. Well actually… Vi cocked her head to the side. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Damn.</span>
  </em>
  <span> No alcohol needed. Past the uptight attitude, the former chairman’s daughter has got it going on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn waved around the room. “Welcome to Piltover U… I didn’t quite catch your name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s Vi.” Vi even reached forward and held out her hand. “Vi Lane.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn hesitated for only a moment then slipped her hand into Vi’s, gasping quietly. “You’re Vi. You created the Atlas Calibration.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi didn’t know how to react from the raw adoration she suddenly saw in her roommates expression. It was strange really. How this rich upper class (could be a model) of an omega babe was looking over her. But whatever it was Caitlyn contained it very well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, how I got a full ride here. You read about inventors from Zaun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn mutely nodded. Fiddling with her watch, shirt, or rubbing her fingers. “It was truly </span>
  <em>
    <span>inspiring.</span>
  </em>
  <span> I’m glad you’re here. I hope I’m an excellent choice for a roommate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Had no choice, but…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me too.”</span>
</p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>They became fast friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An alpha and an omega from opposing social classes hung out almost everyday.  And they got to know each other throughout the first week before orientation. Now, they were nearly inseparable. The classes they shared together Vi enjoyed. Walking the omega (who was a bit touchy but Vi didn’t mind one bit) to class seemed to be the highlight of Caitlyn’s mornings. Holding onto Vi’s arm for comfort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you tried the campus tours yet?” Caitlyn asked one evening, laying on her bed while flipping through a few pamphlets she’s been picking up during the week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nope.” Vi grunted through her pushups. “Hard pass. I know… where my classes are. All that matters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Caitlyn watched Vi finish the set. “Still. It’d be nice to get a lay of the campus. Something to do on a slow day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi could feel her skin crawl from the stare. Normally, when someone watches her it sets her on edge. But, for her friend… she wanted to show off. This stare from her strange roommate, oddly, felt nice. “I’ll make a deal with you.” She finished her set and kneeled on the floor, catching her breath. “Join the gym with me. Once a week, and I’ll think about going on those tours with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That hardly seems like a fair deal. What am I getting out of this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Spending time with me.” Vi winked, enjoying the way Caitlyn’s eyes widened, cheeks flushed red while quickly looking away. “Relax. And besides, you’re all limbs but I’ve seen you without a shirt… eh, that came out wrong. But you got muscle on you, omega. I can work with that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a low grunt Vi stood up, legs still shaky from her squats earlier. She approached Caitlyn’s bed and sat on the edge. She grabbed her wraps from Caitlyn’s desk and began wrapping her left hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn was used to it. Outwardly appearing thrilled that the alpha was anywhere near her bed, let alone sitting on it. “Work with me at the gym?” She awkwardly adjusted her glasses. “I’ll be honest, the thought terrifies me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I get it, but it’s a judgment-free environment. You’ll be safe with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn was chewing a pen while just openly staring at Vi’s arms. “Uh huh. Safe. Right.” She breathed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi slowed her movement, nostrils flaring. She looked at Caitlyn and smirked. “Why do you smell like that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like what?” Caitlyn wore a dazed expression, hardly hearing Vi’s words most likely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi leaned over and sniffed. “Are you in heat? I thought you were taking suppressants.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn’s eyes widened with fear and she leaped out of bed. “Oh my god! Can you smell me? Oh the humiliation.” She hugged herself while searching for her bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine. I was just asking, I didn’t mean to embarrass you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t.” Caitlyn rushed to grab a few personal belongings. “I’ll head to the nurse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re closed at this hour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be in Mel’s room.” Caitlyn kept her eyes down and didn’t spare a glance at Vi.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi sat on the bed, puzzled and slightly amused. “Well… she smells great at least.” she looked down at the rising bulge in her pants. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Really</span>
  </em>
  <span> good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, time to burn this energy at the gym before going to bed and taking care of this hardon. </span>
</p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>Second year at the academy in the middle of December Vi woke up in someone else’s bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t meant to, but well…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn was home for the holidays. Harvest of the meats or whatever it was called. An excuse is what it was. Another bad cycle of her suppressants, causing a peculiar reaction (Caitlyn always acted strange around Vi during her heats), forcing the omega to return home to her parents and high-valued physicians to see what the issue was. She’d been gone for weeks with no contact, well barely a letter stating she should return by next week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was sent weeks ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Vi felt lonely. She had no one to annoy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi slowly adjusted on the bed. She could feel the hints of winter just outside the window. And if it wasn’t for the arms around her waist she may have even stayed just for the warmth. Vi had an unexpected rut and she found a more than willing omega to help her out. She quickly sat up and looked over her shoulder. Sound asleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi didn’t wanna deal with the morning after. Even though she was mildly interested if the “romantic” vibes would hit her. None had. She rushed putting her clothes on, hoping to beat the morning crowd and their first period classes. Caitlyn should be coming back to the dorms any day now. Bad allergies and a strange reaction to her suppressants. They hardly worked. But with Counselor Kiramman (who couldn't stay retired for long), she could pull some strings. And Caitlyn was taken out of classes for nearly two weeks now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi kinda enjoyed having the dorm room to herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But man, did she miss Caitlyn. Glares and pretentious attitude and all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi was stepping out into the hall when she heard the omega’s alarm go off. She made a run for it. She was buttoning her school shirt when her ears twitched, hearing the high-pitched laugh that sounded like—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cupcake!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn turned around, dressed in her academy uniform with the heavy signature Kiramman coat. She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>back!</span>
  </em>
  <span> Her eyes crinkled with the intensity of her smile and waved at Vi. It caused an unpleasant feeling, making Vi feel sick to her stomach. But that didn’t matter. Vi jogged the rest of the way. Near sprinting, needing to get there quicker.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Feeling left out as Caitlyn hugged and waved the group of friends goodbye before fully facing her red-faced roommate. “Where’s the fire, Violet?” she smirked,  “I’m sure with an urgency like that Professor Heimerdinger has you on a leash—</span>
  <em>
    <span>oh!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi scooped up Caitlyn in an easy embrace. Burying her face in the Kiramman’s scent. A feeling of home. Confused by the emotions that flooded her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Relief,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Elation,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>…and something </span>
  <em>
    <span>else</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something Vi couldn’t quiet name, or put her finger on it. But, whatever it was, it felt like an itch only Caitlyn could scratch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn hugged her back with just as much enthusiasm. “I should stay away more often. This is a pleasant surprise. You’re normally not one for affection.” Feeling settled when Vi put her back down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Special occasion. I need this distraction,” Vi mumbled, pressing her nose into Caitlyn’s shoulder. “You smell like cupcakes.” She pulled away, and watched as Caitlyn bent down to pick up her school bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Must’ve dropped it when Vi picked her up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The omega hummed. “Your cupcake needs to resemble the fragrance of the pastries, I presume.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi arched her brow and grinned. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>My</span>
  </em>
  <span> cupcake?” She licked her lips at the thought. “Did you bake? What’s the occasion? Did your inner omega find a strapping young alpha to satisfy your heat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn’s cheeks flushed a deep red. And Vi couldn’t wait to tease her about the sex. “Well, actually, I’ve come back with a proposition for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh really?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’d want, of course. I thought about it a great deal, so don’t feel pressured. But, I was wondering if we could—” she trailed off. Each word became quieter and quieter until Caitlyn fell silent. Appearing stunned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi frowned. “You alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn’s nostrils flared. “Did you… are you…?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi was confused by the way Caitlyn took several steps away. “Cupcake?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You smell like someone else’s heat.” Caitlyn imputed. She sounded distant. Not quite angry. Though, not joyful about it either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that.” Vi brushed down the front of her shirt as though it would wipe off the scent completely. “Sorry, I just left her room. I got a surprise rut when you were gone. But don’t worry. I can keep it in my pants, and I also got some help anyway. I should be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn audibly swallowed hard. “Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi wasn’t sure how to proceed with the intense stare. “Yeah.” She was an alpha of many words. “Can I walk you to class? We can discuss this ‘proposition’ of yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn’s grip on her box of cupcakes tightened. “You’re—you,” it was hard seeing her best friend so distraught over something so mundane. “You’ve mated with another omega.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why does it seem like this bothers you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi cleared her throat. “Yeah, but no. We didn’t mate. We just had sex to relieve ourselves. Her parents haven’t put her on suppressants yet and I’m well… I haven’t either. It was—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I baked these for you.” Caitlyn roughly shoved the box of cupcakes in Vi’s hands, startling the already confused alpha. “Happy birthday, Vi. I have classes and homework I need to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, wow, thank y—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be in the library if you </span>
  <em>
    <span>need</span>
  </em>
  <span> me. Which I doubt you will.” Caitlyn may have accidentally brushed past Vi’s shoulder a little too roughly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi let herself stagger, confused by the whirlwind of emotions reflected in Caitlyn’s glare. She looked down at the box in her hands and turned to see Caitlyn march around the corner of their dorm hall. “Did I say something wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heat-pressed omegas are complicated, Vi thought and brushed it off for now. Giving Caitlyn the space she needs.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p>
  <span>Caitlyn was back in their dorm, seemingly asleep and facing the window when Vi returned from her last class of the day. But Vi was perceptive, she could see how the omega held her breath as Vi approached her bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi purposely bumped Caitlyn’s dresser to announce herself. “Can we talk?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m asleep,” Caitlyn groaned, grabbing a handful of comforter and pulled it over her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi rolled her eyes. “Yeah, I can see that. Listen, Caitlyn, I’m sorry for whatever I said earlier.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing that needs to be reconciled, Violet,” was mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then why does it seem like I’m in trouble?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not… </span>
  <em>
    <span>ugh!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Caitlyn quickly sat up to face her roommate. “I’m not angry with you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She says </span>
  <em>
    <span>angrily</span>
  </em>
  <span>,</span>
  <em>
    <span>” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Vi teased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And </span>
  <em>
    <span>there</span>
  </em>
  <span> it was, Caitlyn fighting the smile. Lips quivering. “Stop that. I’m not angry. And it’s stupid anyway. I shouldn’t be bothering you with my… Forget about it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi pulled up Caitlyn’s desk chair and sat down. “Bother me. You’re my best friend, cupcake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not missing the way Caitlyn hugged her knees whispering </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘best… friend…’</span>
  </em>
  <span> under her breath. “It’s stupid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Something’s bothering you, so it’s not stupid at all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When you were,” Caitlyn quietly began, pulling the blankets tighter around her shoulders, hoping to disappear, “...when you were with the omega, did you feel something with her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At Vi’s confused, blank stare Caitlyn elaborated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um, remember those conversations we used to have in our freshmen year?” Vi nodded. “Well, most of those we’ve only discussed the omega’s behavior around alphas during their heats. Well, you’re very secretive about your ruts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You never asked about them.” Vi shrugged, not seeing how this was her fault.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” Caitlyn agreed. “But that was because… I wasn’t sure how to approach that with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just ask.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn let out a frustrated groan. “Ugh, Violet, you make it sound so simple.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi smiled. “It can be that simple. I’ve asked you plenty of personal questions and you’re more than willing to answer them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Caitlyn hummed, biting her lip and appearing shy. “I didn’t mind you knowing how I felt about certain things during my heat. But then it got me thinking, do alphas feel the same way? So, I’ll just ask you. When you were with the omega during your rut, was it because you wanted it to be her and no one else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi wasn’t sure how to answer that… since… she’s never thought about it. “I’m going to be honest, cupcake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn looked away, dreading the answer perhaps?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think of her </span>
  <em>
    <span>like that</span>
  </em>
  <span> at all. I mean, no offense to her. It was just, I don't know, convenient I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi watched as her friend's shoulders dropped as though a heavy weight lifted, and it was interesting how Caitlyn appeared… relieved. Smiling softly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe Vi read the signs all wrong. “Was it supposed to mean something? Should I talk to her about it? I can call her toni—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Caitlyn nearly shouted aggressively. “No, sorry. I was just… wondering. So you only used her to relieve yourself?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God,” Vi groaned and covered her face. “You make it sound so bad. But yeah, I did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn laughed quietly. “It’s not. It’s completely normal actually. I don’t know why it bothered me so much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi’s attention snapped to Caitlyn. “It bothered you?” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Why?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn blushed. “I–well, not really—but sort of in a way I don’t feel comfortable enough to explain. If that’s okay with you? I’d rather not open that doorway when it doesn’t have to be. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Clearly </span>
  </em>
  <span>it doesn't need to be,” she whispered while looking down at her lap, picking her nails. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, cool. Am I still in the dog house?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You never were,” Caitlyn whispered honestly. “Strange heat is all. I’ll control my emotions better next time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I wish you wouldn’t feel that way.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn rubbed her neck, appearing mildly ashamed of herself. She looked everywhere but at Vi, and when her attention finally settled on the other person in the room she looked… miserable. “Can I know who, sorry… curiosity is getting the best of me, but who was it? Who were you with while I was away?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Elora.” Vi answered quickly before she lied and made up some random chick. Confused in her willingness to create a no name for her best friend. “It was just last night, though. One night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Elora.” Caitlyn repeated. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘I don’t want to hate Elora.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>she whispered under her breath. She squeezed her eyes shut and inhaled sharply. “Just a relief for your rut, huh? Makes sense. Perfect sense. The most reasonable outcome, if I’m being honest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You okay, cupcake?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, sure.” Vi slowly nodded, mindful of her next words. Assuming she needed to approach this topic with as much care and thoughtfulness as Caitlyn seemed to be putting into it. “A one time thing.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Promise. I already forgot about it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Understandable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi scooted the chair closer. “Well, since that’s settled, can I tell what I’ve been up to these past few weeks? It’s actually pretty neat, I’ve been wanting to tell you but—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does it involve an omega?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi hesitated. “No–well, yes… </span>
  <em>
    <span>err</span>
  </em>
  <span>—kinda?” Vi slowly reached for her notebook she left on Caitlyn’s desk. “Am I not allowed to be lab partners with one? I’ll ask Professor Hoskel to switch me out with Jayce if it’s going to—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Violet.” Caitlyn giggled, the sound bringing a calm sensation to Vi. Near her chest area. “I was joking, terrible one, I can see. That’s not necessary. You don’t need to do that. I’m not in a good mood post-heat. You know I get so possessive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi smirked. “Yeah, I know. I kinda like it,” Vi confessed, inwardly praising herself from the way Caitlyn seemed to respond to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn bit her lip and nodded. “May I request something… going forward?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whenever you’re with an omega, can you not tell me about it? I don’t want to know about them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something weird settled in the pit of Vi’s stomach. She wasn’t sure what to make of it. Was this anger? Jealousy? Confusion? …regret? Vi settled on relief. “Yeah, sure. As long as I don't hear about the alphas you sneak into your bedroom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Caitlyn defended herself, posh accent becoming thicker with her anger… until she saw the coy smile Vi was giving her. “I haven’t. I’ve never done that..”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi went on about her gauntlet invention—Jayce may have helped a little. All things said and done, the two friends fell into a comfortable conversation. Vi even squealed, remembering something. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh wait! Before you go to sleep, I got something for you.” Vi rushed to their mini fridge and pulled out the same box Caitlyn had placed Vi’s four homemade cupcakes in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn was sitting at her desk by now and swirled it around, genuinely curious. “Did you put leftovers in there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” Vi was beaming and opened the box, showing one last cupcake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn arched her brow, confused. “I—don’t understand. You’re giving me a cupcake I baked you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, I thought we could share.” Vi pulled it out, tongue sticking out in childish glee. “It’s not a true birthday dessert unless it’s shared with the people you care about the most, right? Here, take a bite, so I can eat the rest. I’ll make my wish after.” she held up the giant cupcake for Caitlyn to bite into.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the omega just stared at her with an unreadable expression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi thought she fucked up. She lowered her hand. “Unless, I’m doing it wrong? Is that not the saying? Should I have eaten this by myself? I guess I shouldn’t tell you I gave one to Powder. She begged me not to tell you, but I know she enjoys your baking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn stopped Vi from pulling the cupcake away from her. “How do you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi blinked. “Do what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Caitlyn started then stopped herself, shaking her head. “Nothing. It’s nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Doesn’t look like ‘nothing’.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, yes that’s the saying. Lemme take a bite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vi excitedly held it up again, and Caitlyn took a generous bite out of her own cupcake. “Nice.” Vi made her wish, and shoved the rest into her mouth, choking on the frosting. </span>
