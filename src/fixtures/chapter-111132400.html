Waiting for her phone to buzz the reply. The only reason she rushed her date out of her apartment. Hers and Caitlyn’s shared apartment. Thanks to Counselor Kiramman’s deep pockets, she was able to help her and Caitlyn find an affordable home near their college campus. Vi wasn’t in a rut, but this omega had helped her out a few months ago.</p><p>Apparently she thought that was an invitation for seconds. Vi didn’t do second dates. And especially at their apartment. Unofficial rule she and Caitlyn had. But this lassie just showed up hoping to relieve her heat with Vi. But Vi always had her “fall out” plan.</p><p>“Did you want to visit this Riverside wine bar? It appears to be on Zaun’s side of the river, but I hear they have an amazing seafood restaurant.”</p><p>“Jericho’s.” Vi said without looking up from her phone.</p><p>The cute busty redhead turned to Vi. “Pardon?”</p><p><em> Ugh. </em>Vi refrained rolling her eyes. “It’s a fast food bar. Not really what you’re looking for. But…” Vi’s phone buzzed on her lap and she nearly jumped for joy when she read the message. “Change of plans. I know a place down on the river strip.” Vi leaned forward and tapped the driver’s shoulder. “Hey man, extra 30 bucks to turn around and head back to Riverside Strip. This place.” She held out her phone for the driver.</p><p>“Damn. I would’ve done it for 5,” he agreed. </p><p>“Sweet. Thanks, man.”</p><hr /><p> </p><p>They made it to the place in no time. And Vi quickly got out of the car with the busty redhead close behind her. A small college town club called the Hexgates.</p><p>Gave Piltover University students discounts on pretty much everything on the menu besides alcohol. Once Vi and Caitlyn turned 18 they came here every chance they got to burn energy and celebrate the weekend. The amount of times they returned to their apartment drunk off their asses seemed countless.</p><p>Now, they use it for <em> this. </em></p><p>“Whoa there, darling. Why the fire?” the <em> Fortunate </em> busty date called out. Heels clicking on the brick walkway in her rush to keep up with Vi’s long strides.</p><p><em> Got places to be, ‘darling.’ </em> Vi nodded towards the doorman and he subtly gave a thumbs up. <em> Perfect. </em></p><p>They didn’t have to wait long to find a seat at a table. But Vi played her part, albeit temporary. She leaned in. “Want anything to drink?” Before her date could answer, Vi howled loudly. “Yo! Holy shit! Gimme a minute babe, gotta catch up with some old classmates of mine.”</p><p>Vi walked away before her ‘date’ could say anything.</p><p>There was poorly hidden urgency in her walk as Vi quickly headed to the bar where she could see a gorgeous bombshell nursing a cocktail. Caitlyn had left hours before having a study session with Mel and Elora, but they decided to come here for Vi’s “emergency” get away.</p><p>From this angle, Vi could only see Caitlyn’s side profile and <em> god damn, </em> is it normal to find your best friend attractive? Well, if they’re Caitlyn Kiramman, then that’s a given. She grew well into her awkward body and long limbs. Vi barely remembers being taller than Cait. Now her favorite omega was all thunder legs, thin waist (great breasts) , beauty of a fertility goddess, and a heart of gold. </p><p>Her hair was pulled into a high ponytail and she was dressed in a sexy cocktail dress (definitely expanded her wardrobe). With her oversized glasses still on, Cailyn looked like a high school teacher attempting to get out of her comfort wardrobe for a night on the town.</p><p>And she fucking nailed it. Pure <em> ‘Step on me, mommy’ </em> vibes.</p><p>Vi loosened her tie as she stepped in behind the omega, leaning <em> dangerously </em> close as she placed a possessive hand on Caitlyn’s waist. “Damn, cupcake, you’re so hot you look ready for this knot,” she purred near the omega’s ear. “What’s an alpha gotta do ‘round here to get a sample of your frosting?”</p><p>Caitlyn's shoulders shook with her not so hidden laughter. “Oh, that one was horrible, Vi. C+. You’re getting better, though.”</p><p>Vi rested her chin on Caitlyn’s shoulder and hugged her best friend from behind. “Was that tempting, though? Get your panties in a twist?”</p><p>“Drier than Mel’s high priced wines.”</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>Caitlyn smiled as Vi settled on the bar stool next to her, keeping her back towards her date-not-a-date. “I’m sure your inflated ego will recover.”</p><p>Vi smirked. “<em>Psh. </em> You make sure my ego stays in check.”</p><p>“Someone needs to. It’s a wonder how you’ve managed to get anyone into your bed. Your pickup lines are atrocious.”</p><p>“It’s because I’m hot, cupcake. They take one look at me and don’t hear a word I say after that.”</p><p>“Looks aren’t always everything. I’ve seen you on your worst days.”</p><p>“Damn,” Vi whispered breathlessly, looking at Caitlyn as though she hung the stars. “I love it when you peg me with your words.”</p><p>Caitlyn rolled her eyes and grinned. “Oh god.”</p><p>Vi noticed her drink and reached for it. “Oh, is this a <em> Negroooni</em>—”</p><p>“Don’t start,” Caitlyn warned.</p><p>“...sbagliato—”</p><p>“<em>Violet</em>."</p><p>“...with prosecco in it?” Vi said with a very well-practiced Piltovian accent.</p><p>“<em>Stunning</em>.” Caitlyn mumbled dryly. “That’s it. I wanna divorce your friendship. You’re never letting me live that down are you?”</p><p>Vi was too busy laughing and grabbing the cocktail to down the rest of it. “Drunk Caitlyn is my favorite Caitlyn—holy shit, this was strong! Is the ice frozen Campari?”</p><p>“It was pretty strong,” Caitlyn agreed with a subtle nod. “Lux didn’t make this one. That could be why.”</p><p>Vi coughed and waved down the bartender. “Hey, Lux, can I get another for Cupcake?!”</p><p>The young blonde woman nodded and continued making her other drinks.</p><p>Caitlyn leaned forward. “You didn’t have to do that. I ordered it for you, actually. Clear your mind to escape your—<em>you know</em>.”</p><p>Vi tried to ignore the fluttery feeling in her stomach. “Aw, cupcake, you like me or something?”</p><p>“Unfortunately. And you’re so predictable.” Caitlyn turned to fully face Vi. “Now, who is she, if she’s still here?” Caitlyn tried to discreetly look over Vi’s shoulder seeing if there was an irate omega glaring in their direction.</p><p>This was Vi’s favorite part.</p><p>The nearly imperceptible predatorial look in the omega’s eyes, framed by the cutest glasses, as deep blue eyes searched the club for another. And Caitlyn played her part to the fullest. Grabbing Vi’s thigh and squeezing it possessively. The pheromones immediately followed. And Vi loved it. She wondered why. Omegas don’t usually ‘fight’ over alphas. If anything, it would be the alphas fighting over an uninterested omega.</p><p>But Caitlyn…</p><p>Vi couldn’t put her finger on it, but there was something underlying in her friend’s actions and responses. As though Vi was already hers. Vi’s nostrils flared at the scent. The days leading up to her heat made Caitlyn one dangerous woman who’s scent was so inviting.</p><p>Vi couldn’t get enough.</p><p>“Busty redhead. Table 5.” Vi was watching her friend’s expressions shift from mild curiosity to an apathetic arched brow.</p><p>“Sarah Fortune? I thought I smelled a salty rat around here.”</p><p>Vi laughed quietly. “Is that her name or you’re being an asshole? You’re one omega prime to mess with, huh?”</p><p>Caitlyn smirked. “You don’t remember her?”</p><p>“Barely.”</p><p>“It’s incredible how you haven’t double dipped in your ‘snack box.’ Oh, Violet: notorious heart-breaker, body of a warrior, emotionally inept—and the personality of a wolf,” Caitlyn roasted her. But Vi knew Caitlyn thought the world of her.</p><p>
  <em> Wait. </em>
</p><p>Vi blinked slowly. “Don’t wolves mate for life?”</p><p>Caitlyn was clearly distracted. “She ate the banana bread I baked for you, my mochi, and my leftover udon. I also heard she dropped out of college, moved here. Trying to make it big in the City of Progress.”</p><p>“She’s moving here, huh? Maybe I should finally settle then.” Vi loved testing the waters.</p><p>
  <em> There it is. </em>
</p><p>Caitlyn’s reaction was instant, grabbing Vi’s chin and pulling her close. “Not with <em> her </em>,” she spoke calmly but with a commanding yet gentle tone.</p><p> Vi could feel Caitlyn’s breath on her lips. “You have such impossible standards for me, huh? None of them ever meet your requirements.”</p><p>And it was true. Caitlyn never liked any omega that Vi would try to “date”.</p><p>
  <em> ‘She’s a bit too posh for you.’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘No. She ate my banana bread.’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘Isn’t she the one who tried to get Jinx expelled?’ </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘She has anger issues and is utterly immature.’ </em>
</p><p>“Practical standards. They’re achievable, Violet.” Caitlyn leaned back, keeping her attention over Vi’s shoulder. “And someone has to look out for your well-being. She has company now. You can move on from whatever <em> busty </em> hold she had on you.”</p><p>Vi smiled at the aggressive tone. “Jealous?”</p><p>The omega rolled her eyes. “You wish. Jayce and Mel are sitting at a table. We can go with them. Are you hungry?”</p><p>Caitlyn’s attention fell on Vi, but the alpha was just simply enjoying observing her friend. </p><p>Vi had a dazed expression, leaning on the hand that was still holding her chin. “Are you on the menu?” Vi asked, wiggling her brows flirtatiously. </p><p>They did this a lot. </p><p>Flirt without consequence. </p><p>…without discretion.</p><p>To be honest, Vi did it one year after a heavy discussion with Caitlyn about Vi’s increasing determination to not find a mate. She playfully asked Caitlyn to be hers for the month. The omega wore the most lethal glare before cracking under Vi’s dopey grin. And Vi never stopped. Finding angry Caitlyn absolutely sexy. Maturity was realizing this temptress of an omega was beneath that nerdy roommate all along and slowly bringing her out.</p><p>Caitlyn leaned in close again, tightening her grip on Vi’s chin. Their noses brushed, and Vi wondered if Caitlyn was finally going to—</p><p>“You couldn’t afford me, Violet.” the omega near whimpered seductively.</p><p>“I have student credits,” Vi whispered before clearing her throat and shook her head to clear the wave of arousal. </p><p>Caitlyn appeared triumphant, leaning back and grabbing her fresh cocktail off the bar counter. “Come on. They’re waiting for us.”</p><p>Vi slid off her stool and blindly held out her hand. “Pretty boy was allowed in? Fucking scandal.” She looked around the club for the pretty boy and the second hottest omega in the room. </p><p>When Caitlyn grabbed onto her hand, Vi pulled her along towards the table. She found Mel right away, as Jayce was just returning to the table. </p><p>The younger Medarda didn’t seem surprised to see Vi there with Caitlyn. “Well, hello there, Violet. I was wondering where Caitlyn went off to. Can’t have one without the other, right?”</p><p>Vi snickered as she sat down, leaning close to give the high class student council member a kiss on the cheek. “Caitlyn loves me too much to leave me at home.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure that’s what it was.” Mel sent Caitlyn a secretive look.</p><p>Caitlyn sat down and scanned the menu QR code, pulling it up on her phone. </p><p>Jayce clapped Vi on the shoulder as he passed her chair. “Vi, hey you just missed Leo—<em> ow! </em>” </p><p>Vi was leaning close to look at Caitlyn’s screen for the food options, she looked up when Jayce yelped. “Damn, you’re a spaz, pretty boy.”</p><p>Jayce was red in the face and he avoided looking in Caitlyn’s direction as he sat down. Giving Mel an apologetic smile.</p><p>Vi recognized when the air was tense, but that also meant it wasn’t her problem to deal with. </p><p>“How do you feel about steak?” Caitlyn asked, ignoring the tension at the other end of the table.</p><p>Vi’s kinda gal.</p><p>“How do you feel about breathing?” Vi replied.</p><p>Caitlyn bit her lip and smiled. “Of course. I've been craving meat since I came back. My mother fed me a vegan meal and that’s not something I wanted these past few days. You want to share a plate?”</p><p>
  <em> We always do. </em>
</p><p>Caitlyn ate like a bird after her heats, but before she ate as though the world was about to end.</p><p>Vi shrugged, “If you want. Get the 16 oz.”</p><p>“Fries?”</p><p>Vi nodded while getting up. “I’m going to get me a whiskey neat. Want a chaser for that gasoline you’re drinking?”</p><p>Caitlyn scoffed. “Sure.”</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>When Mel dropped them off, Caitlyn couldn’t stop giggling, Vi was crawling on all four up the stairs, and Mel made sure they both made it to their door.</p><p>Vi stumbled through the front door and began unbuttoning her shirt. “Fuck, I hate this shirt. It feels so weird on me. Why haven’t I thrown it out?”</p><p>She was struggling with the bottom buttons and Caitlyn’s hands quickly replaced them. Swaying in place. “I love this shirt on you.”</p><p>
  <em> Oh. Maybe that’s why. </em>
</p><p>“Really brings out your eyes and hair color.”</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>Vi stood still as Caitlyn unbuttoned the rest, then slid it over her shoulders. Fingers lingering on Vi’s exposed and warm skin. It felt nice. When Caitlyn got this way. Touchy. Usually it happened a lot more before her heat. Vi could always tell it was around the corner and her best friend was packing to leave to nest at her parents house… away from Vi—Caitlyn gets real touchy. Hugs Vi all the time. Touching her arms, holding her hands, asking to sit next to her on the couch while she studies.</p><p>Burying herself in Vi’s scent before she left.</p><p>
  <em> Why leave when you can— </em>
</p><p>Caitlyn stumbled. “Oh shit!” She laughed at herself, as she nearly pushed Vi over. “Sorry! It was the Negroooooniiiii.”</p><p>Vi laughed as she steadied Caitlyn on her feet. “Yeah? What else was it?” </p><p>“Oh my god!” Caitlyn squealed as Vi knelt down to grab the back of her knees and scooped her right up. “Spagliatooo—<em> teheheee </em> , it sounds so absurd!” Caitlyn held onto Vi’s shoulders. “Wow, you’re <em> really </em> strong. I wonder if I can carry you... I ate a lot, Violet.”</p><p>“Drank a lot too, like you were celebrating something.” </p><p>“Always a good time to be merry when my <em> best friend </em> is here with me.” Caitlyn sang out. “You’re with me, Violet, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I’m here, cupcake.” Vi carefully carried her drunk roommate to her side of the apartment. Laying Caitlyn on her bed. But the omega kept a firm hold around Vi and pulled the alpha on top of her. “<em>Oomph!” </em></p><p>“Yes!” Caitlyn squealed in glee. “Stay the night, Vi. Lay with me, please. I want to simply breathe you in before my heat comes.” The omega ran her rose along Vi’s neck.</p><p>Vi held herself up so she wasn’t hurting Caitlyn. “You like my alpha scent.”</p><p>“Mhm.” Caitlyn hummed, running her hands over Vi’s arms. Dragging her nose over Vi’s neck, chin, and her cheek. “But I thoroughly enjoy your scent. Yours. Violet Lane. Very much so.”</p><p>“I’m sure you do.” Vi let Caitlyn get her fill. </p><p>Ignoring the pleasant feeling of being scent-marked by a beautiful omega. They were both drunk. And they tend to get this way. Feeling each other. They were both very comfortable in their sexual nature. And Vi would be lying to herself if she said she didn’t mind Caitlyn returning to their apartment, smelling of another alpha. It grinded her teeth and set every nerve on fire. </p><p>Vi wanted Caitlyn to smell like herself and no one else. But they weren’t an item. They’ve actually never tried going <em> there </em> before. Well, unless being drunk counts.</p><p>But,</p><p>Vi didn’t belong to Caitlyn. They were best friends. Vi was just a trencher alpha. Caitlyn deserved better than her. She deserves more than—Vi let out a blissful sigh when she felt Caitlyn’s lips on her neck. Giggling and kissing it. Grabbing Vi’s hips and pulling them harder against her own. Vi went along with it, rolling her hips so Caitlyn could feel the erection she caused. Caitlyn whimpered her response and began sucking on Vi’s neck with lustful fervor.</p><p>Vi even closed her eyes, losing herself to the sensation. It felt nice. Caitlyn always feels great. They’ve grinded before, teasing each other. The aromas surrounding them added an additional enjoyment. <em> Pleasure. </em> Vi squeezed Caitlyn’s thigh, more than tempted to push them farther apart, lift Caitlyn’s dress, rip off her underwear and just <em> slide </em> inside—Vi stopped her hips, feeling a moment of clarity.</p><p>And yet, still too weak to pull away completely.</p><p>‘<em>Violet…’ </em> Caitlyn mumbled into the sensitive skin. Caitlyn said another word that Vi didn’t catch. Sounded like “mine” but that was obviously not right.</p><p>Vi hissed when she felt Caitlyn’s sharper teeth.</p><p><em> Cupcake, don’t start something that I’ll be too willing to finish. </em> </p><p>Vi held her breath, feeling Caitlyn rub herself all over Vi’s erection. Seeking. Wanting. Drawing out a breathless gasp from the alpha and sounding pleased by doing so. Vi had to bite her lip to refrain from moaning out loud when Caitlyn bucked her hips. Thighs trapping the alpha where she was.</p><p>“Cait…” <em> Fuck, are doing this? </em></p><p>When Caitlyn’s mouth got <em> dangerously </em>close to her own, Vi cursed herself and pulled away. Ignoring the displeased whimper from the omega.</p><p>“Pants or shorts?” She cleared her throat. If Vi lets them go further, something will happen that they’ll regret in the morning.</p><p>Caitlyn looked disgruntled. “Why did you leave?”</p><p>“You’re drunk, Caitlyn. You don’t know it’s really me.”</p><p>“I will never forget you.” Caitlyn’s head rolled to the side. “Ugh! I need to shower.”</p><p>“Shorts it is. I’m kinda tipsy, cupcake. I can’t help you with that.” Vi slid off Caitlyn’s heels and placed them by her closet door. Then opened Caitlyn’s pajama drawer and pulled out a pair of shorts. </p><p>When Vi turned around Caitlyn was hugging herself, shivering. “I’m cold.”</p><p>Vi’s expression softened as she felt a little more sober by the minute. “I’ll get you some sweats.”</p><p>As Vi stepped out of the walk-in closet still covered in only her sports bra, Caitlyn was struggling to pull her cocktail dress over her head. “Wait, wait, wait! You’ll rip the seams. Stop! Lemme just,” Vi grabbed the hem and pulled it over Caitlyn’s head. “This is a nice dress. If you rip it,  I know you’ll blame me and I might not remember enough to defend myself.”</p><p>“You like it?” Caitlyn asked while pulling up her sweatpants and grabbed the oversized shirt Vi picked out for her.</p><p>“Love it.” Vi turned away to give Caitlyn some privacy as the omega reached behind her back to unhook her bra. </p><p>“Would you wear it?</p><p>Vi smirked. “Love it on <em> you </em>. I’d probably flex once and rip it down the middle.”</p><p>“I miss seeing you wear dresses.” Caitlyn grunted, and it sounded like she flopped onto the bed.</p><p>“You like me in dresses? I wore that sexy bunny costume during Halloween. Hard to keep the omega’s attention off my ass.” Vi looked down at her roommates' dress in her hands.</p><p>
  <em> I imagined it on the floor of my bedroom. </em>
</p><p>Vi blinked rapidly.</p><p>
  <em> Wait, what? </em>
</p><p>Vi put the dress in the hamper and waited. Shaking her head to clear the fog. </p><p>When Caitlyn didn’t say anything for a while Vi risked a glance over her shoulder. “Caitlyn?”</p><p>The omega was laying in the middle of bed, completely passed out. Vi chuckled lowly, and reached over to cover the omega with the available corner of the comforter. “G’night.” She whispered.</p><p>Before leaving the room and closing the door behind her. Vi leaned against the door and sighed loudly. "Fuck."</p><hr /><p> </p><p>They were getting those looks again.</p><p>Vi ignored them while she pulled Caitlyn towards the library. Her omega best friend smelling of her oncoming cycle. Still days away. Manageable. But, Vi’s heard the rumors. And… they don’t bother her. About her and Caitlyn being a mated pair… but they’re not.</p><p>Just unusually close for an alpha and omega.</p><p>The only times it gets ‘in the way’ is when Vi tries to hit up an omega for a quick fuck. And they’ll ask her… <em> ‘What will Caitlyn say about it? Aren’t you pre-mating?’ </em></p><p>
  <em> ‘Isn’t that Kiramman omega your girlfriend?’ </em>
</p><p>…as if Vi would cheat on someone like Caitlyn. Vi tightened her grip on Caitlyn’s hand. And if they were dating… her attention would never stray.</p><p>They’re not, though.</p><p>But, they were also hand-in-hand walking each other to class almost everyday. Because Caitlyn wanted to, and if pleased her friend well... Vi would provide.</p><p>“...then afterwards I have to head downtown with Mel for our meeting with the council. Potential internship after graduation.” Caitlyn was scrolling through her phone, checking her calendar. “I take my suppressants in the hour. Should be fine through the night. Then I’ll stay with my parents that weekend. What about you? Will you be alright?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine if you take suppressants—<em>Ow! </em>” Vi laughed as Caitlyn playfully hit her arm. “Actually, no one will be at the apartment. I have a thing during those three days anyway.”</p><p>“A thing?” Caitlyn whispered while they entered the library. “An entire two nights for you? That’s not very typical of you to even stay the night… let alone two.”</p><p>Vi let go of Caitlyn’s hand and walked towards their usual corner table in the back. She carefully placed her bag on top and pulled out her laptop. “Yeah well, I thought I’d try something new. The Caitlyn Kiramman approach. Seems to work just fine for you.”</p><p>Caitlyn’s demeanor shifted; quieter. Cautious. Curious. “And what sort of approach is that? Perhaps, I’m not even aware of this.”</p><p>“Your nesting period. Staying in your fuck cave for days at a time. Plus, I’ve seen your mini-fridge. Nice stock ups.” Vi explained. “It seems to help you a lot. Staying with your secret alphas for several nights.”</p><p>Caitlyn slowly sat down and pulled out her own laptop. “Who ever said they stay the night? Or that they’re even there to begin with?”</p><p>Now, they both know Caitlyn was no pure omega. But she did have her secrets about her bed partners. Sealed lips never spoke of whoever it was that helped the omega during her heats.</p><p>“Cupcake,” Vi chuckled softly. “You’re gone for days at a time. Sometimes, several weeks. I’m sure you have a line around the block wooing counselor Kiramman to be their daughter’s temporary mate.”</p><p>Caitlyn wordlessly arched her brow. As if to say <em> ‘Are you sure about that?’ </em></p><p>Vi found it interesting. “Two?” <em> Sounds reasonable. </em></p><p>Caitlyn’s expression was overly composed.</p><p>“One?” <em> there’s no way… </em></p><p>Caitlyn bit her lip.</p><p>Now Vi was more than interested. She leaned forward. “None? Wait, are you for real? Do you just use your hex vibe?”</p><p>Is this why Caitlyn desperately craves Vi’s alpha scent before she heads home?</p><p>Caitlyn let out a small puff of air. “The truth may surprise you. And I’d like to change the subject. We have to present this on Thursday. Let’s get started.” mumbling a quiet <em> ‘two nights’ </em> under her breath and forced herself to focus on the spreadsheets her and Vi were creating.</p><p>“Yeah, okay.” Vi heard it. Felt it… could taste the possession in the air. Suddenly, that weekend seemed like a punishment.</p><p>A punishment for not choosing correctly. Vi watched as Caitlyn effortlessly fell back into their normal routine. But she noticed how Caitlyn wasn’t as touchy anymore. A dulled interest, and an underlying sadness that caused Vi to wonder where it came from.</p><p>And if there was <em> anything </em> she could do just to see Caitlyn smile again.</p><p> </p>
